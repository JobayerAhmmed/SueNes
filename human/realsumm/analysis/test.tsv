a pole with convictions for violence was on his way to britain from calais when he snatched a schoolgirl in front of her mother before raping and murdering her , it emerged today . zbigniew huminski , 38 , has confessed to strangling his nine-year-old victim , identified by her first name of chloe , yesterday afternoon in france ‘ while drunk’ . she was stripped naked and sexually assaulted and after being forced into huminski’s car and then driven to an isolated wood once used as a camp for illegal migrants bound for the uk . scroll down for video . on his way to britain : zbigniew huminski ( left ) , 38 , has confessed to strangling his nine-year-old victim , identified by her first name of chloe ( right ) , yesterday afternoon in france ‘ while drunk’ . horrifying : the little girl 's naked body was found in the woods near calais 90 minutes after she was taken . chloe’s mother , named only as isabelle , ‘ heard her daughter’s screams’ as she was being taken away from outside her school in calais - but was unable to do anything . jean pierre valensi , the prosecutor of nearby boulogne-sur-mer , said huminski was arrested hours later and ‘ immediately recognised his involvement in the murder of the child . ’ dna evidence corroborated by an autopsy revealed ‘ strangulation and sexual violence’ , said mr valensi . tests also showed huminski was over the alcohol limit for driving . huminski had been banned from french territory after being convicted twice for acts of ‘ extreme violence’ including attacking a frail pensioner with a knife . but he had driven to france in a polish registered car this week , and intended to travel to britain to stay with family who had emigrated there , said mr valensi . chloe was playing with a friend on wednesday afternoon when she approached huminski , who had stopped his car to drink a beer , and squirted him with her water pistol . remembered : relatives of chloe are joined in a march in calais today following the nine-year-old girl 's death . walking together : the mayor of calais natacha bouchart ( right ) and the mother ( centre ) of chloe , identified only as isabelle , leave calais city hill with relatives today . the pole later told french police that he grabbed her and forced her into his red seat toledo before driving her three miles to the nearby dubrulle wood . isabelle , who had left briefly to take her son to a sports match , began screaming the moment she saw the man , described by witnesses as bald and wearing sunglasses , pushing chloe into his car . the car , which had polish number plates , was found by police near where chloe was killed . isabelle did not even have time to reach chloe 's father so they could launch a formal missing persons appeal before her body was discovered . ' i 've begun to understand i will never see chloe again , ' isabelle told le parisien . ' it 's tough . very hard . above all , i do not know when or how i 'm going to tell his little sister and little brother . they are only five and four years old , i do not know if they can understand . ' huminski , who is single , originally moved to france in the early 2000s , and worked as an odd-job man before attempting to join the foreign legion as a soldier . he was rejected because of his criminal background , and then said he wanted to go and live with his sister in england . huminski was on his way to southampton , where his sister lives , french prosecutors confirmed tonight . flowers : ms bouchart ( left ) comforts isabelle ( right ) , as relatives and people gather during a march in calais . emotional day : a person holds a portrait during a march in calais in homage to the nine-year-old girl . in 2009 he was lodging in calais with a bulgarian immigrant when he attacked a pensioner in her own home , tying her up , before running away with the equivalent of £50 in cash . psychiatric reports presented in court portrayed huminiski as a ‘ chronic alcoholic’ known for violent burglaries in both france and britain . he was last convicted in france in april 2010 , when has jailed for six years for aggravated assault , before being released early on march 27 , 2014 , when he was deported to warsaw . chloe is said to have pointed a water pistol at huminski as part of a childish game before he bundled her into the back of his red seat toledo at about 3.30pm yesterday , the prosecutor said . the child’s body was found around two hours later , three miles away in the dubrulle wood . sadness : women place flowers at a playground in the neighbourhood where chloe was taken yesterday . distraught : today people laid flowers at the place where the girl was snatched by the polish man ( pictured ) . until a few weeks ago , it was the site of a large immigrant camp , made up of mainly men trying to get aboard ferries sailing to the south coast of england . such camps are regularly razed by the french authorities , with the migrants moved on . natacha bouchart , the calais mayor , said : ‘ i was informed at 4.30pm that a young girl was abducted by a man in a red car as she left school in the chateaubriand area of calais , at around 3.30pm . a city security chief found an empty red car registered in poland in dubrulle wood , in the north of the city . ‘ he then called the police , who found the body of the girl in the woods . during the same patrol , they found the person who owned the vehicle , apparently a polish national . ’ the mayor has been at the forefront of a campaign to clear out all illegal migrants from her city , saying they are behind all kinds of crimes in the region . tragic decision : chloe 's mother had let her continue playing in calais because it was nice outside . shocking : prosecutor jean-pierre valensi ( pictured ) said forensic investigators reported evidence of ' strangulation and sexual violence ' , and that the polish man in question had admitted to the killing . the mother of a child who went to school with chloe told agence france-presse : ‘ it 's horrific . my son knew her , he did n't sleep last night . he knows he will never see her again . i ca n't even imagine what the parents are going through . ’ french prime minister manuel valls called for light to be shed on the suspect 's history , saying the family and community were ' deeply shocked ' by the murder . ' it is up to the legal system now to carry out the investigation and what we owe to the family is the whole truth , ' he said . calais was plunged into mourning after the killing of the girl described as ' cheerful and full of life ' . residents planned a march in memory of chloe today . flags in the town were already being flown at half mast . huminski will now be kept in custody pending a criminal trial for murder .	zbigniew huminski , 38 , has confessed to strangling his nine-year-old victim she was stripped naked and sexually assaulted and after being forced into her car and driven to an isolated wood once used as a camp for illegal migrants bound for the uk her mother , named only as isabelle , ` heard her daughter 's screams ' as she was being taken away from outside her school in calais dna evidence corroborated by an autopsy revealed ` strangulation and sexual violence ' huminski was banned from french territory after being convicted twice for acts of ` extreme violence ' including attacking a frail pensioner with a knife	zbigniew huminski , 38 , has confessed to strangling his nine - year - old victim . she was stripped naked and sexually assaulted after being forced into huminski ' s car . chloe ' s mother , named only as isabelle , ‘ heard her daughter ’ s screams ’ as she was being taken away from outside her school in calais - but was unable to do anything . dna evidence corroborated by an autopsy revealed ' strangulation and sexual violence ' .	zbigniew huminski , 38 , has confessed to strangling his nine-year-old victim . chloe was stripped naked and sexually assaulted after being forced into his car . she was then driven to an isolated wood once used as a camp for illegal migrants . chloe 's mother ` heard her daughter 's screams ' but was unable to do anything . huminski had been banned from french territory after being convicted twice for acts of ` extreme violence '	zbigniew huminski, 38, confessed to strangling nine-year-old 'chloe' in france . she was stripped naked and sexually assaulted before being driven to woods . huminski had been banned from french territory after being convicted twice for acts of 'extreme violence'	zbigniew huminski , 38 , has confessed to strangling his nine-year-old victim she was stripped naked and sexually assaulted and forced into huminski 's car he had driven to france in a polish registered car this week , and intended to travel to britain to stay with family who had emigrated there dna evidence corroborated by an autopsy revealed ` strangulation and sexual violence '	zbigniew huminski , 38 , has confessed to strangling his nine - year - old victim , identified by her first name of chloe , yesterday afternoon in france .she was stripped naked and sexually assaulted and forced into huminski ’s car and then driven to an isolated wood once used as a camp for illegal migrants bound for the uk .dna evidence corroborated by an autopsy revealed ‘ strangulation and sexual violence ’ , said mr valensi .

( cnn ) on the surface , the mix-up seems incomprehensible : how can a volunteer sheriff 's deputy accidentally fire a handgun instead of a taser , killing a man ? that 's apparently what happened in tulsa , oklahoma , when a 73-year-old reserve deputy , robert bates , killed eric harris . bates said he meant to use his stun gun but ended up firing his handgun instead . `` oh ! i shot him . i 'm sorry , '' bates said in a video of the shooting . but it 's happened before . in a well-publicized 2009 case , a bay area rapid transit police officer fired his gun instead of his taser , killing 22-year-old oscar grant in oakland , california . the former officer , johannes mehserle , testified that he had meant to use his taser but drew his gun instead . mehserle was sentenced to two years in prison for involuntary manslaughter but was released early due to good conduct . so how easy -- or hard -- is it to draw and fire a handgun mistakenly instead of a taser ? here are some factors to consider : law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer 's dominant side of the body , and the taser should be placed on the nondominant side . so if an officer is left-handed , the gun should be on the left side . bates ' attorney said his client is left-handed . but the reserve deputy said his gun was holstered on his right side -- his nondominanant side . `` i shoot long guns left handed and handguns right handed , '' bates said in a written statement to investigators . after bates announced at the scene he was going to use his taser , he `` used his nondominant hand , and it was the gun , '' said clark brewster , bates ' attorney . `` he said that he saw the laser sight on the shoulder , assumed it was the taser , '' brewster said . `` both the gun and the taser have a laser sight , and he just made a mistake . '' brewster also said his client 's left hand was holding a pepper gun . in his statement to investigators , bates said he had grabbed a `` pepper ball launcher '' to try to slow or stop harris , who was running away . bates did not say explicitly where the taser was on his body . but he admitted to grabbing the wrong device and said he was `` startled '' by the recoil of the gun . `` after realizing what had happened i was in a state of shock and disbelief , '' he told investigators . bates is now charged with second-degree manslaughter . if convicted , he faces up to four years in prison . deputy who shot eric harris turns himself in . bates was carrying his personal gun , a smith & wesson .357 five-shot revolver , and a model x26 taser , he said in his statement to investigators . attorneys representing the harris family said there are stark differences between the two devices . one held up a small black .357 revolver , followed by a mostly bright yellow taser that was noticeably larger than the gun . `` there 's no way an officer can get this confused with this , '' said one of the attorneys from the law firm of smolen , smolen & roytman . taser 's x26 model comes in different designs . some are mostly yellow , while others are mostly black with a yellow panel in the middle . but all appear to be larger than smith & wesson .357 five-shot revolvers . sgt . jim clark of the tulsa police department -- which is separate from the county sheriff 's office for which bates volunteered -- said bates was the `` victim '' of something called `` slip and capture . '' that 's when a person intends to do one thing but instead does another in a high-stress situation . but a criminal justice expert told cnn the claim amounts to `` junk science . '' `` there 's no peer-reviewed articles that would support this . ... it 's not generally accepted by the scientific community , '' said phil stinson , an assistant professor of criminal justice at bowling green state university . `` so it 's something that in most courts would not be admissible as evidence . '' an attorney for the harris family said the `` slip and capture '' theory has n't held up in court . `` the only time slip and capture has ever been used as a defense was in the shooting in oakland ( of oscar grant ) , '' the attorney said . and that defense failed . tasers are built to feel and look different than guns , according to taser international . steve tuttle , vice president for strategic communications at taser , noted some of those differences to cnn : a gun is heavier . a taser has a different grip and feel . when you take the safety off on a taser , an led control panel lights up . there 's more : tasers can be different colors ( yellow or black ) , and the holster is different from a gun 's . but in the field , where an officer reacts on instinct , there are other distinctions outside of the product itself that are important , tuttle said . taser 's training calls for the stun gun to be placed on an officer 's nondominant side , as law enforcement experts say . and its training suggests that officers shout aloud , `` taser ! taser ! taser ! '' as they prepare to deploy it . these guidelines are designed so that in the moment -- when an officer 's muscle memory kicks in -- the body reflexively knows which weapon it is reaching for . it is up to each law enforcement department , however , in how it trains personnel and what regulations it requires as far as placement on the body . the company declined to comment on the tulsa shooting in particular . the stun guns , or conducted electrical weapons , manufactured by taser have been used more than 2.7 million times , tuttle said , and are designed to be used in situations that are not considered life or death . cnn 's catherine e. shoichet , brooke baldwin , ed lavandera and mariano castillo contributed to this report .	oscar grant , 22 , was sentenced to two years in prison for involuntary manslaughter " i 'm sorry , " robert bates said in a video of the shooting bates ' attorney says his client is left-handed and the taser should be on the left side	a reserve deputy killed eric harris in tulsa , oklahoma , in 2009 . law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer ' s dominant side .	law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer 's dominant side of the body , and the taser should be placed on the nondominant side . the reserve deputy 's attorney said his client is left-handed , but he said his gun was holstered to his right side . the officer is a veteran of the tulsa police department .	oklahoma deputy says he meant to use his taser but ended up firing his handgun . experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer's dominant side of the body .	a 73-year-old reserve deputy , robert bates , killed eric harris in tulsa , oklahoma bates said he meant to use his stun gun but ended up firing his gun instead law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer 's dominant side of the body	law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer 's dominant side of the body , and the taser should be placed on the nondominant side .mehserle was sentenced to two years in prison for involuntary manslaughter but was released early due to good conduct .

a cafe owner has laid down a challenge to diners with a gut-busting morning meal that contains a whopping 4,000 calories . olly taylor , 27 , is offering his version the easter feast , which is stuffed with the equivalent of almost 100 teaspoons of sugar , at his black milk cafe in manchester 's northern quarter . the breakfast includes two types of cereal served in half an easter egg , with brownies , marshmallows and mini eggs , topped off with three different types of flavoured milk . the easter feast breakfast is available at the black milk cereal cafe in manchester 's northern quarter . up for the challenge : customer glen keogh attemps the 4,000-calorie meal which has 388g of sugar . the meal is so sweet it contains the equivalent of 388g of sugar or 97 teaspoons . for £7 , customers looking to get their day off to a jittery start will be treated to a 291g milk chocolate easter egg , with one half used as a bowl , served on a bed of baked and caramelised white chocolate to support the structure . two cereals of choice are added together with a creme egg , a handful of mini eggs , home-made chocolate brownie and a flake chocolate bar . marshmallows and m & m 's are thrown into the mix , before the whole dish is generously drizzled in homemade dulce de leche - an argentinian take on condensed milk - and salted caramel sauce . he starts off in high spirits , pouring the first of the three milks into his chocolate ' bowl ' . mr keogh takes on the easter feast ( left ) but barely gets through before he regrets his decision ( right ) . finally , customers are treated to three milks of choice which can be taken from a range including black squid ink milk , chocolate , strawberry , vanilla and good old semi-skimmed . mr taylor , whose cafe specialises in world cereals , milkshakes and cheesecake , says he has carried his fine-dining and knowledge of being a wine sommelier into black milk . he created the easter feast challenge to celebrate the gluttony of easter . cadbury 's chocolate egg ( 291g ) : 150g sugar ; 1,400 calories . baked caremalised white chocolate : 9g sugar ; 80 calories . kosher cereal from israel : 8g sugar ; 150 calories . toffee crisp cereal : 7.2g sugar ; 150g calories . home-made brownie : 7g sugar ; 410 calories . creme egg : 26.5g sugar ; 177 calories . mini eggs : 20.5g sugar ; 148 calories . flake : 16.7g sugar ; 171 calories . dulce de leche : 50g sugar ; 315 calories . salted caramel sauce 10g sugar ; 300 calories . milks : 30g sugar ; 300 calories . marshmallows : 40g sugar ; 75 calories . m & ms : 13g sugar ; 140 calories . total : 3,816 calories . average man needs 2,500 calories per day . ' it 's all in the spirit of easter , ' he said . ' easter is less about what is used to mean , and now on easter sunday people try and go through as many chocolate eggs as they can , so this is another challenge for them . ' no one has managed to finish it yet but we 'll be running it until the end of the bank holiday to see if anyone can . ' he said the initial idea for the easter feast came to him after seeing soup served inside giant bread bowls in paris and he wanted to transfer the concept to the cereal market . ' i want to push it further and come up with wacky concoctions and push the limits of cereal and milk and what you can do with it , ' he said . although his cafe may stake a claim to creating britain 's most tooth-rotting dish , mr taylor is keen to point out some of the shop 's biggest sellers are muesli , special k and protein granolas used as an after-gym snack . sweet-toothed customer glen keogh bravely attempted the challenge , opting for toffee crisp and a kosher cereal from israel as his two choices . he said : ' i absolutely love chocolate , so this seemed like it would be a doddle at first . ' after tucking straight into the crème egg , the flake and the brownie , i realised even that was more chocolate than anybody needs to eat in one sitting . ' the cereal was delicious , but like the easter egg bowl once the milk was poured , i started to crumble . ' ten minutes , an aching belly and fuzzy teeth later , i called it a day with just the bowl to spare . my nine-year-old self would have been disappointed , but he did n't have to pay to go to the dentist ! ' the easter feast is made of half a cadbury 's chocolate egg ; baked caremelised white chocolate ; kosher cereal from israel ; toffee crisp cereal ; home-made brownie ; creme egg ; mini eggs ; flake ; dulce de leche ; salted caramel sauce ; three milks ; marshmallows and m & m 's . olly taylor starts the assembly process for his sugar-laden easter feast breakfast .	customer glen keogh attemps 4,000-calorie meal is available at the black milk cereal cafe in manchester 's northern quarter the meal is so sweet it contains the equivalent of 388g of sugar or 97 teaspoons two cereals of choice are added together with a creme egg , a handful of mini eggs , home-made chocolate brownie and a flake chocolate bar	the easter feast is available at the black milk cereal cafe in manchester ' s northern quarter . it contains two types of cereal served in half an easter egg , with brownies , marshmallows and mini eggs . for £7 , customers are treated to three milks of choice which can be taken from a range including black squid ink milk , chocolate , strawberry and good old semi - skimmed .	olly taylor , 27 , is offering his version of the easter feast at his black milk cafe in manchester 's northern quarter . the breakfast includes two types of cereal served in half an easter egg , with brownies , marshmallows and mini eggs . it contains the equivalent of 388g of sugar or 97 teaspoons of sugar .	olly taylor, 27, is offering his version of the easter feast at his cafe in manchester's northern quarter . the breakfast includes two types of cereal served in half an easter egg, with brownies, marshmallows and mini eggs . the meal is so sweet it contains the equivalent of 388g of sugar or 97 teaspoons .	olly taylor , 27 , is offering his version of the easter feast at his black milk cafe in manchester 's northern quarter the breakfast includes two types of cereal served in half an easter egg , with brownies , marshmallows and mini eggs , topped off with three different types of flavoured milk it is so sweet it contains the equivalent of 388g of sugar or 97 teaspoons	olly taylor , 27 , is offering his version the easter feast , which is stuffed with the equivalent of almost 100 teaspoons of sugar , at his black milk cafe in manchester 's northern quarter .the easter feast breakfast is available at the black milk cereal cafe in manchester 's northern quarter .

apple made significant improvements to the battery life of its iphone 6 and 6 plus , but they still fail to last more than a full day with typical usage . to address these issues , the tech giant is recruiting for battery and power software experts . at least nine job listings have been spotted on the firm 's official recruitment site as the company looks to boost the battery across its range of mobiles and laptops . fan site appleinsider has spotted nine job listings on apple 's official recruitment site in the past month that relate to batteries . these include one for an ios battery life software engineer ( pictured left ) and another for ios software power systems engineer ( pictured right ) . the job listings were discovered by fan site appleinsider and include listings for an ios battery life software engineer , a software power systems engineer , battery pack engineering manager and a cell engineer . in particular , the ios software power systems engineer role said the successful candidate ' will be working on design and development of software for triage of battery life issues , modeling of power consumed by different parts of the system , and analytics to understand large scale battery life trends . ' apple defines the apple watch battery on its watch product page . it says its all-day battery life is based on 18 hours of use . all-day battery life : this includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . audio playback : the battery will last up to 6.5 hours when playing music . talk time : apple said the watch can be used for up to three hours for calls . workout : during this test the watch lasted for seven hours when a workout session was active and the heart rate sensor was on . watch : when used as a watch the device will last for 48 hours if checked five times an hour . power reserve : when the apple watch 's battery gets low it switches into power reserve mode letting users tell the time for up to 72 hours - with four time checks an hour . charging time : the company said it takes 1.5 hours to charge the watch to 80 % and 2.5 hours for a full charge . apple 's tests were carried out in march 2015 with a pre-production apple watch and software paired with an iphone using pre-production software . apple said battery life varies with environmental factors , use , configuration , and ' many other factors ' so actual results will vary . as the site suggests , this shows apple is looking to boost the battery on ios devices but also its range of macbooks . apple 's larger iphone 6 and 6 plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person . these times have only been beaten by samsung 's latest galaxy s6 . apple also said its new 12-inch macbook uses 30 per cent less energy than the previous model and could last more than nine hours on a single charge . however , official figures suggest its watch in particular will struggle to last for anywhere near that long . boss tim cook said at the launch event last month that the watch will last 18 hours , but this only includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . apple is expected to launch an iphone 6s , 6s plus as well as potentially a four-inch model later this year . battery improvements could be made to these handsets , or they may be a feature on next year 's iphone 7 . alternatively , because a number of the jobs refer to a software rather than hardware engineer , these battery improvements could be made and rolled out to existing phones as part of an ios upgrade . earlier this week atmel released its latest microcontrollers ( mcus ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can harvest energy from a person 's body . the sam l microcontrollers are part of atmel 's 32-bit arm-based mcu range and are powered by chip maker arm 's cortex m0+ 32-bit processors . a number of apple devices , including the iphone 5s and ipad air are powered by chips based around arm technology . atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices such as fire alarms , healthcare , medical , wearable , and devices placed in rural , agriculture , offshore and other remote areas . ' apple 's iphone 6 and 6 plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person . apple also said its new 12-inch macbook ( pictured ) uses 30 % less energy than previous models . apple boss tim cook said the watch 's 'all-day ' battery life lasts 18 hours with ' typical use ' - but official tests recently revealed this equates to just 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . apple defines the battery on its watch page and said a time check lasts four seconds . they use a third of the power of rival chips and tests have shown they are the lowest power microprocessor ever made . the microcontrollers run on the firm 's picopower technology and atmel 's event system that makes different parts of the device work together to carry out tasks . by effectively ' sharing ' energy , the whole device uses less power and , subsequently , less battery . it can also manage how much energy is being used by other components to make them as efficient as possible . plus , the technology is so low power it can harvest energy from the body using changes in temperature . earlier this week atmel released its latest microcontrollers ( mcus ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person 's body . atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices ' . during a demonstration of the microcontrollers at this year 's ces , andreas eieland , atmel 's director of product marketing demonstrated how he could power a radio by placing his hand on a panel . this panel recognised a change in temperature between the hand and the room and this was harvested to create charge .	fan site appleinsider has spotted nine job listings on apple 's official recruitment site in the past month that relate to batteries these include one for an ios battery life software engineer , a software power systems engineer , battery pack engineering manager and a cell engineer this includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music the company said it takes 1.5 hours to charge the watch to 80 % and 2.5 hours for a full charge	fan site appleinsider has spotted nine job listings on apple ' s official recruitment site in the past month that relate to batteries . these include listings for an ios battery life software engineer , a software power systems engineer , battery pack engineering manager and a cell engineer . this includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30 - minute workout with music .	fan site appleinsider has spotted nine job listings on apple 's official recruitment site in the past month that relate to batteries . these include listings for an ios battery life software engineer , a software power systems engineer , battery pack engineering manager and a cell engineer . apple has made improvements to the battery life of its iphone 6 and 6 plus . but they still fail to last more than a full day with typical usage . the company is recruiting for battery and power software experts to address these issues .	fan site appleinsider has spotted nine job listings on apple's official recruitment site in the past month that relate to batteries . these include one for an ios battery life software engineer . other listings include a software power systems engineer and a cell engineer . apple has made significant improvements to the battery life of its iphone 6 and 6 plus but they still fail to last more than a full day .	apple has spotted nine job listings on apple 's official recruitment site these include one for an ios battery life software engineer , a software power systems engineer , battery pack engineering manager and a cell engineer the company defines the apple watch battery on its watch product page it says its all-day battery life is based on 18 hours of use this includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music	fan site appleinsider has spotted nine job listings on apple 's official recruitment site in the past month that relate to batteries .at least nine job listings have been spotted on the firm 's official recruitment site as the company looks to boost the battery across its range of mobiles and laptops .apple defines the apple watch battery on its watch product page .

former sunderland defender danny higginbotham has described a controversial speech made by roy keane which he calls ' one of the most bizarre team talks i 've ever experienced ' . higginbotham and his black cats team-mates were about to take on aston villa during the 2007-08 premier league season when keane sat them down in the home changing room at the stadium of light . but instead of encouraging his players to put their poor start to the season behind them , the former manchester united midfielder delivered an astonishing team talk . republic of ireland assistant manager roy keane ( left ) looks frustrated during his country 's draw with poland . keane watches his sunderland players in action against aston villa after delivering his ' bizarre ' team talk . danny higginbotham ( right ) gave struggling sunderland the lead during the game on december 15 , 2007 . in his new autobiography rise of the underdog : my life inside football , higginbotham - who scored in sunderland 's 1-1 draw with villa that day - describes keane 's attempt to motivate his players . ' '' listen lads , ' he said . ' basically you 're s*** . try and enjoy the game . you 're probably going to get beat . but just enjoy being s*** . '' ' then he just walked out . those words have got to be insulting to any professional , no matter who they come from , and i 'll admit it served as the perfect motivation to get out there and prove him wrong . i scored after 10 minutes and we were leading at half-time . we ended up drawing . ' higginbotham also reveals how keane once demanded for him to swear at and criticise his team-mates instead of getting behind them . aston villa winger shaun maloney ( right ) scored a free-kick to secure a 1-1 draw for the visitors . keane is now part of martin o'neill 's backroom staff after leaving his role at aston villa earlier this season . higginbotham ( right ) , pictured in action against manchester city , played under keane for a season . referring to a talk with keane , higginbotham writes : ' '' danny , all i 'm f****** hearing from you when i 'm watching that game yesterday is f****** encouragement . that 's all i 'm hearing . '' i thought , well , that 's not so bad . `` i do n't f****** want that . i want you to tell some of them they 're being c**** . tell them . '' ' despite a 2-0 loss away at bolton in the season 's penultimate game , sunderland secured their premier league safety with a match to spare . but although he had helped ensure another year in england 's top-flight , keane was in no mood to praise his players after their defeat against gary megson 's side . higginbotham ( left ) now works as a pundit after hanging up his boots in january , 2014 . reliving his manager 's post-match team talk , higginbotham writes : ' '' you 're the reason i 'm driving up and down the f****** country to find another player , you 're not f****** good enough , '' he yells at one player . ' '' your attitude is s*** . you 're not good enough , '' he bawls at others . ' '' next week we 've got our last home game , against arsenal . you know at the end of the season when you walk around the pitch , thank the fans for their support ? i 'm ringing umbro and getting you some hooded jumpers , because you 're a f****** embarrassment , it 's a joke and this is not going to stay this way .

arsenal defender per mertesacker has tipped compatriot jurgen klopp to make his mark in the barclays premier league if he opts to continue his career in england . klopp , 47 , announced earlier this week that he would end his seven-year stint at borussia dortmund when the current season draws to a close , prompting fresh speculation that he could head for the premier league . manchester city have already indicated that a man who has also been linked with manchester united and arsenal in the past , is not in their sights , but germany international mertesacker insists klopp would be a good fit in the english top flight . jurgen klopp has revealed he will be vacating his role as borussia dortmund boss at the end of the season . arsenal vice-captain per mertesacker says klopp would be a top manager in the premier league . klopp chats with dortmund defender erik durm during a training session in dortmund on wednesday . he said : ' i 've got some nice experiences in the premier league and of course it would be nice if a german coach would take the challenge of working in the premier league . ' it 's not so good for dortmund that he is leaving but hopefully one day he will manage abroad . i think his passion would fit and to see him in england would be very interesting . ' everyone has their philosophy and i think jurgen klopp has proved that he 's top-level and can teach a lot . ' however , mertesacker insisted klopp , whose side are 10th in the bundesliga table , will need time to decide on his future after a largely successful spell in dortmund which has brought two league titles and a champions league final appearance . he said : ' i think he should just finish the season with dortmund and then he should be given time . ' we 'll see what he does next , but i think he 's fought his way out of all situations and i think that this time he will find a path that gives him a new challenge . ' but firstly , i wish him all the best and time to think about his achievements . sometimes you can underestimate what it 's like going straight into a new job . i think you should give him time - and i wish him all the best . ' klopp waves to the fans after dortmund 's champions league game against arsenal in november . the german boss has enjoyed a huge amount of success at dortmund and won the bundesliga title twice . but for all that a new challenge lies ahead for klopp , mertesacker admits he can not work out what has gone wrong to prompt his exit from borussia . he said : ' it is obviously sad news for borussia dortmund , [ he was ] such a passionate successful and passionate manager for them . he was the guy who turned it around at dortmund . ' the whole situation there - he built the squad on young players and they improved so much in the seven years he was in charge . it is a sad situation . ' but in the summer , it will be a new situation for him . maybe he is going to go abroad and see how it goes there . ' i would love to see more german managers abroad , because it is obviously a new challenge , to adapt to the culture , the language , the system . yes , why not ? ' it is his decision . he worked really hard and pushed really hard , so even if he said he is not tired , maybe he takes a bit of breather to fuel his energy and his batteries ? ' but i am curious what happened to him because he was an outstanding figure in the bundesliga in the last couple of years and always a title contender . they went to the champions league final . it will be interesting to see what happens in the summer .

by the time bobby zamora caressed the ball with sublime precision on the gallop to lob boaz myhill from the edge of his area , the impression was firm that even the highly improbable can happen . this was quite likely the finest goal of zamora’s long career , a strike of rare quality that never looked on seconds before the ball was in the back of the net . chris ramsey will hope queens park rangers’ season can follow a similarly implausible trajectory . written off by many , this victory , only a second on the road all season , claws qpr closer to safety . bobby zamora ( left ) scored qpr 's third goal with an astounding lob from a narrow angle against west brom at the hawthorns . charlie austin ( right ) headed qpr 's second goal of the game for his team on the 35th minute . the

where bobby zamora struck qpr 's third goal . joey barton’s name was sung loud by travelling fans at the final whistle , in recognition of a fine display capped by a goal in added time to give this win an emphatic scoreline . he drove onto a lose ball in the west bromwich albion box and lashed home with the ferocity of someone determined not to go down with a whimper . earlier , in the 84th minute , he received a forearm in the face from substitute youssouf mulumbu that saw referee lee probert produce a red card . was mulumbu’s act in retribution for barton’s claims albion players had ‘s***’ themselves when leading 2-0 at loftus road in december to lose 3-2 ? only he will know . what is without question is that ramsey’s team are fighting for their lives . five successive defeats preceded this game , but three points paints fresh gloss on their survival hopes . for tony pulis , this was a bad day . his talks with chairman jeremy peace once safety is assured will have to wait .

swung over a deep cross to find brown ideye , but the nigeria striker directed his header above the bar . moments later , the visitors were ahead in stunning fashion . a long ball by robert green was helped on by zamora and nodded into the path of vargas by austin . the chilean cut across two west brom defenders and let fly a cracking shot the other direction , utterly defeating myhill from 25 yards . ‘ how s*** must you be , we’re winning away , ’ sang the travelling hoard . the hosts responded , with a cross by chris baird sent trickling wide by ideye four yards out . soon after vargas went down clutching his knee with nobody near him . baird continued play to the fury of sandro , who rushed over once the ball had gone dead to remonstrate in rather close proximity to the albion defender . vargas tried to continue but hobbled off minutes later , bringing the introduction of niko kranjcar . the croatian delivered a telling contribution in the 37th minute , flicking on a corner by matt phillips to find austin unmarked at the far post . the qpr striker applied the finishing touch as expected to take his premier league tally to 16 , his fourth against west brom following a hat-trick in the fixture at loftus road . two minutes before the interval , zamora provided that moment to take the breath . phillips played the ball to the forward but danger seemed distant by the corner of the area . instead zamora glanced a shot with the outside of his left boot to send the ball soaring high before dropping into the corner of the net . it was joyous . qpr had done enough .

berahino . green ( centre ) makes a save for qpr as berahino closes in on goal in the game at the hawthorns . pulis , no doubt furious with his team’s defending , introduced victor anichebe at half-time and his big frame had a sizeable effect . in the 55th minute presented a very appealing chance for craig gardner but only a tame shot followed . three minutes later anichebe had a goal for himself . saido berahino latched onto chris brunt’s long pass and dug out a cross that anichebe reached ahead of steven caulker to steer into the far corner . pulis replaced chris baird with jonas olsson and changed to a 3-4-3 formation , instigating an albion surge . robert green punched clear a deflected shot by ideye . berahino ten scuffed an excellent chance from four yards and ideye headed another over . green , the qpr goalkeeper , celebrates his team 's opening goal from vargas . barton ( centre ) has his shirt pulled by craig gardner of west brom in the premier league game . west

with the premier league season entering its final stretch , focus is now turning to the summer transfer window . many clubs will be looking to snap up a bargain free transfer and there are plenty to choose from . here are best players who are currently set to leave their premier league clubs on a free in june . manchester city 's tenacious , creative and versatile midfielder james milner could leave as a free agent . goalkeeper - gerhard tremmel ( swansea ) . at 36 years old , he is no spring chicken , but tremmel could prove a useful acquisition for a newly-promoted side . tremmel has played second fiddle to michel vorm and then lukasz fabianski during his four years at swansea , but has performed well when called upon in the cup competitions and was in goal when the swans beat bradford in the capital one cup final two years ago . swansea 's gerhard tremmel , 36 , is the understudy for lukasz fabianski but has done well in the cups . right-back - glen johnson ( liverpool ) . england 's first-choice right-back at the world cup is still a regular for liverpool , but he looks almost certain to end his six-year spell at anfield this summer . johnson , who has 54 england caps , is on a bumper deal at the merseyside club and there seems to be little appetite to keep him on the books . england 's first-choice right-back at the world cup looks set to leave liverpool after six years this summer . centre-back - kolo toure ( liverpool ) . another regular at liverpool who is still to extend his contract . toure kept cristiano ronaldo quiet with an excellent display when real madrid came to anfield in november , but the 34-year-old ivorian lacks consistency and has made some terrible gaffes in his time at the club . inconsistency has been kolo toure 's curse - the 34-year-old ivorian has produced some howlers at liverpool . centre-back - ron vlaar ( aston villa ) . vlaar performed so well at the world cup that his omission from the team of the tournament raised a few eyebrows , especially when thiago silva was selected ahead of him . injury has restricted the dutchman to 16 appearances for villa this season . at 30 , he has at least a couple of years left in him yet and will surely be courted by other top-flight teams . holland 's ron vlaar was a surprise omission from the team of the world cup but could leave aston villa . left-back - luke garbutt ( everton ) . everton have been doing everything they can to tie this promising young defender down to a new deal , but he is yet to put pen to paper . the 21-year-old has played nine times for everton this year and faces a big battle to displace leighton baines so he may fancy a challenge elsewhere . everton want to lock the talented 21-year-old luke garbutt down for the long term but he 's yet to commit . right wing - james milner ( manchester city ) . probably the most high-profile free agent available this summer , milner has 15 years ' worth of top-flight experience to his name and 53 england caps . milner is both tenacious and creative , either in the centre of midfield or out wide , and he is still a year off his 30th birthday . milner has 15 years in top flight experience , 53 england caps and still is n't 30 , so a great buy for someone . central midfield - mikel arteta ( arsenal ) . named arsenal captain last summer , but arteta has not played for the gunners since november due to injury . hard to see him displacing the in-form francis coquelin on his return . may be 33 , but still has a good eye for a pass and is also a free-kick specialist . mikel arteta has n't played for arsenal since november due to injury and will need to displace francis coquelin . central midfield - tom cleverley ( manchester united ) . named captain for a tour match against roma last summer , cleverley clearly thought he had a future under new united manager louis van gaal .

this is the incredible moment a man narrowly missed being burnt alive by a massive fireball which erupted from the pavement . father-of-two shiraz nawaz said he felt lucky to be alive after the 15-foot flames shot out of the manhole just seconds after he had walked over it in a busy street in the west midlands . the 36-year-old had been on his way to his local takeaway when he heard buzzing from the ground just a few feet behind him . flames as high as 15ft tall erupted from a manhole in the west midlands just moments after a pedestrian had walked over it . shiraz nawaz , 36 , said he felt lucky to be alive after he narrowly missed being burnt by flames shooting out of the manhole . as he turned around he noticed the charred ground and watched on as thick black smoke began billowing from the manhole . the smoke was followed by a huge blast of flame which shot out 15-foot of the ground on the pedestrian walkway . further bursts of flame and thick black plumes of smoke were to follow . despite his shock , the building contractor was able to grab his phone in time to film the terrifying incident . ' had it literally been a few seconds earlier i would have been walking right over it , ' said a shaken mr shiraz . mr nawaz said he had been walking to his local takeaway when he heard buzzing from the ground just a few feet behind him and noticed the blackened cover . as he watched on in shock , thick black smoke began to escape from the manhole in the busy street in shirley , solihull . ' i 'm so lucky i did n't get burned . i think i used up one of my lives right there . ' i 've never seen anything like it , and i have been in the building trade . ' miraculously nobody was hurt in the incident , thanks to mr shiraz who had evacuated the nearby takeaway . the former gas engineer told the staff to turn off the gas supply and also rang the fire service after the incident in the busy stratford road , shirley , solihull . firefighters extinguished the blaze , which they said was caused by a fire in an underground link box - which distributes electricity - below the manhole . neighbouring properties had to be evacuated and many others lost power for several hours as crews tackled the electrical fire which was thought to have started accidentally . shiraz , who now fits kitchens and bathrooms , said : ' to think that i had just walked over that . ' the flames kept shooting up - maybe five or six times . the smoke was followed by a quick blast of flame which shot out of the manhole on the pedestrian walkway . flames shot up to a startling 15-foot high and could be reaching the top of the nearby shop and take away fronts . ' i 'm a building contractor so i knew that when i heard the noises it was something to do with electrics . it was like a buzzing . ' i knew what it was but i did n't expect flames to come shooting out straight away or anything like that . shiraz was walking from his home to the dixie chicken shop around the corner from his home when he saw the flames at around 7pm on monday . ' i got my phone out because i heard the actual noise and i think i saw a flash , ' he said . ' i think i managed to get it on film just as the first real flames came up . ' it looked like it was coming from a manhole cover . it was quite shocking . ' i told the guys in the shop to switch off the gas and get everyone out . i told them to stop any unassuming person from walking down the road while i stayed on the other side . flames were followed by more plumes of dark smoke continued to billow up out of the charred ground reaching several feet high . miraculously nobody was hurt in the incident after shiraz evacuated the nearby takeaway , told them to turn off their gas supply , and called the fire service . ' the guy in the shop grabbed me a couple of burgers after everything , so i guess it had a happy ending . ' a spokesman for west midlands fire service said : ' we had a number of calls about about it - probably five or six , maybe a couple more . ' it involved a fire in an underground electrical link box . the electrical supply was isolated by western power . ' power was isolated to surrounding homes and premises for four hours . ' three people were evacuated from one of the properties . ' we used a co2 extinguisher and a hose real with foam , because it was an electrical fire . it was accidental . ' western power distribution workers were later seen repairing the man hole cover in shirley , solihull . the area had been evacuated and blocked off as western power distribution employees worked to fix the underground link box . incredibly no-one was hurt in the incident and quick-thinking shiraz managed to grab his phone in time to take a film of the astonishing flames .	father-of-two shiraz nawaz , 36 , said he felt lucky to be alive he had been walking to his local takeaway when he heard buzzing from the ground just a few feet behind him firefighters extinguished the blaze , which they said was caused by a fire in an underground link box	shiraz nawaz , 36 , said he felt lucky to be alive after the 15 - foot flames shot out of the manhole in the west midlands . the father - of - two had been on his way to his local takeaway when he heard buzzing from the ground just a few feet behind him . as he turned around he noticed the charred ground and watched on as thick black smoke began to escape .	shiraz nawaz said he felt lucky to be alive after flames shot out of manhole . the 36-year-old had been walking to his local takeaway in shirley , solihull . he heard buzzing from the ground just a few feet behind him and noticed blackened cover . as he turned around he watched on as thick black smoke began billowing from the manhole . father-of-two was able to grab his phone in time to film the terrifying incident .	father-of-two shiraz nawaz, 36, was on his way to takeaway in shirley, solihull . he heard buzzing from the ground just a few feet behind him . as he turned around he noticed the charred ground behind him . as he watched on in shock, thick black smoke began to billow from the manhole . huge blast of flame shot out 15-foot of the ground on the pedestrian walkway . miraculously nobody was hurt in the incident .	shiraz nawaz , 36 , said he felt lucky to be alive after the 15-foot flames shot out of the manhole just seconds after he had walked over it in a busy street in the west midlands as he turned around he noticed the charred ground and watched on as thick black smoke began billowing from the manhole despite his shock , the building contractor was able to grab his phone in time to film the terrifying incident	shiraz nawaz said he felt lucky to be alive after the 15-foot flames shot out of the manhole just seconds after he walked over it .the 36-year - old had been on his way to his local takeaway when he heard buzzing from the ground just a few feet behind him .flames as high as 15 ft tall erupted from a manhole in the west midlands moments after a pedestrian had walked over it .

justin rose will try to take a leaf out of rory mcilroy 's book after kickstarting his season with his share of second place in the masters . rose arrived at augusta national having missed the cut in three of his previous five tournaments on the pga tour , but left with renewed enthusiasm and a 14-under-par total which has only been bettered six times in masters history . ' i 'm really excited about the rest of the year now . it 's a good momentum starter for me , ' said rose , who was looking to become the first european player to win the us open and masters . justin rose was unable to take victory at the masters , despite carding 14-under-par for the tournament . rose believes that his finish of second at augusta can boost his season with some big events ahead . rose wants to follow the lead of rory mcilroy , who had a relentless winning streak in the summer of 2014 . ' i tried to really tell myself that this year for me is going to be about april to september when the big tournaments come around and that 's when i want to play well . ' you look at rory 's year last year , it was all about how he played in the summer ( winning the open , bridgestone invitational and us pga in the space of four weeks ) . i was trying to keep telling myself it 's a long year . very happy it turned around this week in a major championship . ' the thing that was most important for me this week was the fact that i have not been in contention and i have n't had a lot of experience this year or positive vibes on which to draw . ' i was really pleased at how comfortable i felt in that situation , last group in the masters on sunday . i think that 's when you learn a lot about yourself and that makes me very hungry to get there again very soon . ' rose began the final round four shots behind spieth and closed to within three on three separate occasions on the front nine , but was never able to get any closer . ' there 's two ways to look at it . you can think that 14 under par , i 'll take that next year and i 'll take that the year after and i 'll take it the year after , so i have to take a lot of confidence from that , ' he added . rose had struggled to hit top form going into the masters but now hopes to sustain his augusta form . rose ( left ) congratulates tournament winner spieth and praised his performance level for the week . ' but you 've got to play it on the day , too . i felt like there were a few moments out there where i could have done better and i 'll learn on that and think about that . ' jordan did n't really open the door and i did n't really expect him to . really the one time on the back nine where it got interesting for me was the 16th hole . i felt that if i make my birdie putt and jordan misses for par , it 's a two-shot swing and i 'm two back with two to play . but my putt just slid by and he made a great eight- footer to there to keep his momentum as he did all day , really .

john helm was commentating on bradford city’s game against lincoln city when the fire broke out and still struggles to listen to his description of that fatal day . here he gives his insight into what caused the blaze . it was a day i have often tried to forget , but it was the one i must always remember . approaching the 30th anniversary of the bradford city fire , it was inevitable i would be asked to recall the horrific images from a match i was commentating on for yorkshire television . what i did not expect was for someone to suggest the fire may not have been an accident , as martin fletcher has done with his book fifty-six , the story of the bradford fire . the tragic fire at bradford city 's valley parade stadium claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on may 11 , 1985 . martin lost three generations of his family and has a right to speak his mind — any bitterness would be understandable — but from everything i have been told there isn’t a jot of evidence to suggest the blaze was caused deliberately . on the contrary , i remember the coroner telling me it was obvious how the fire had started . detective inspector raymond falconer actually identified a man who had dropped a lit cigarette that went down a hole in the stand and started the fire . this corroborates what i was told at the time by the coroner . he said it was believed the fire had been started by a man , visiting this country from australia , but his name was never revealed . without making allegations against the club’s chairman at the time stafford heginbotham , there is inference by implication in the book — with reference to a series of fires at factories owned by the now deceased heginbotham . as members of his own family were seated in the stand that day , and as it was due to be demolished anyway 48 hours later , it is unfathomable to think there could have been an act of arson . i find it abhorrent that stafford heginbotham’s family are being subjected to this unseemly inference at a time when people are still grieving and paying their respects three decades on from the most horrendous day of their lives . there isn’t a shred of evidence to suggest anything other than a terrible human tragedy . it should also never be forgotten that heginbotham twice saved bradford city from extinction . as son james said to me : ‘ he put that club above everything else , including family and business . ’ a memorial at valley parade pays tribute those who died in the devastating blaze almost 30 years ago . we all have our memories of a day that still sends a shudder up my spine . i can not bear to watch the footage . if i hear my voice describing the tragedy as it unfolded i have to leave the room . many of the 54 bradford and two lincoln fans who lost their lives , choked to death with inhalation of fumes . the smell was of acrid tar . as a bradfordian myself i knew many of those fleeing for their lives , as i attempted to describe the scenes without becoming over-emotional . thirty years on we try to forget but we must always remember . sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article .	john helm was commentating on bradford city 's game against lincoln city when the fire broke out and still struggles to listen to his description of that fatal day it was a day i have often tried to forget , but it was the one i must always remember . what i did not expect was for someone to suggest the fire may not have been an accident , as martin fletcher has done with his book fifty-six	john helm was commentating on bradford city ' s game against lincoln city when the fire broke out and still struggles to listen to his description . he lost three generations of his family and has a right to speak his mind – any bitterness would be understandable – but from everything i have been told there isn ’ t a jot of evidence to suggest anything other than a terrible human tragedy . it should also never be forgotten that heginbotham twice saved bradford city from extinction .	the tragic fire at bradford city 's valley parade stadium claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on may 11,1985 . john helm was commentating on bradford 's game against lincoln city when the fire broke out . helm says there is n't a jot of evidence to suggest the blaze was caused deliberately .	john helm was commentating on bradford city's match against lincoln city . approaching 30th anniversary of bradford city fire, helm recalls horrific images . helm says there isn't a jot of evidence to suggest blaze was caused deliberately .	john helm was commentating on bradford city 's game against lincoln city when the fire broke out he says there is n't a jot of evidence to suggest the blaze was caused deliberately coroner told him it was obvious how the fire had started it is unfathomable to think there could have been an act of arson it should never be forgotten that stafford heginbotham twice saved bradford city from extinction	martin fletcher has done with his book fifty -

the european union will today accuse google of illegally abusing its supremacy on the internet search market . brussels will say that google has used its massive dominance as a search engine to divert internet users from rivals to its own services , which include youtube and the google+ social network . in one of the most high-profile competition cases of recent years , europe could fine google more than £4 billion amid a wave of political opposition in europe to the perceived dominance of us tech companies . google currently boasts a 90 per cent share in europe 's search engine market . the european union will accuse google of illegally abusing its supremacy on the internet search market . but the ruling - the result of a five-year investigation into the american search giant – means google may ultimately have to change its business model and pay multi-billion pound fines to brussels . margrethe vestager , the eu 's competition commissioner , will today serve the company with a formal charge sheet alleging that it breached anti-trust rules , according to the financial times . google 's competitors , including the computer giant microsoft and sites such as travel booking firm expedia and tripadvisor , claim that its method of promoting its own companies above rivals on its search site stops them competing on a level playing field . and in a further blow to google , the eu is also expected to probe google 's operating system for android smartphones . the investigation will centre on whether google imposes restrictions on phone makers that force them to favour their own apps , such as youtube . google has previously rejected the allegations , and insisted that android is an open platform that is distributed for free . margrethe vestager , the eu 's competition commissioner , will today serve google with a formal charge sheet . after charges are issued , google will have ten weeks to reply to brussels , according to the financial times . they will also get the chance to argue their case in a formal hearing . the investigation into google began in 2010 but was repeatedly delayed because the commission could not agree on settlement terms . google offered three settlement proposals to resolve the case . most recently , just over a year ago , it offered to give competing products and services bigger visibility on its website . however europe initially accepted that deal , only to reverse the decision six months later and demand more concessions . vestager , europe 's competition boss who was the inspiration for the hit danish political drama series borgen , took over the job in november and vowed to take google on . insiders claim the case could prove just as costly as the eu 's decade-long battle with microsoft , which ultimately cost the company £1.6 billion in fines . if google fails to rebut any formal charges imposed by brussels , the commission could impose a huge fine which could exceed £4 billion - about 10 per cent of google 's most recent annual revenue . the move will stop short of previous threats that the eu executive could consider breaking up google to separate its business from the search engine . google has faced searching antitrust questions across three continents for several years . but the latest move by the eu marks the first time the company has been accused of wrongdoing . the search engine is far more dominant in europe than it is in the united states – where rivals like microsoft 's bing enjoy a share of the market . and there has been fierce opposition to the dominance of google from many countries in the eu . in fact twenty complainants want the search engine to abide by strict rules than ensure it treats its own services the same as it would its rivals . more than two dozen european organisations have filed antitrust complaints against google . many are from powerful publishing groups and online firms in germany . they have previously called on the european regulator to force the american search engine to stop blocking competition in areas like online maps , shopping and travel services . and in france , lawyers have this week called on google to reveal its secret formula for ranking websites – but google argues such transparency would expose its business secrets to rivals and leave the search engine vulnerable to spam . google and the eu commission declined to comment last night . vestager 's department is also looking into the tax affairs of amazon , starbucks , fiat and apple . in a recent sunday times article she said big companies should pay more as they ' are part of our society .

a four-poster bed which was dumped in a hotel car park and sold for £2,200 has been verified as once belonging to king henry vii – and it could now be worth millions . the intricately-carved ornate bed was left in the car park of the former redland house hotel in hough green , chester , by builders who were renovating the property . oblivious to its true value and historical significance , the construction workers dismantled the piece of oak wood furniture and left it to be picked up by auctioneers . the four-poster oak wood bed ( above ) , which was dumped in the car park of redland house hotel in chester and later sold at auction for £2,200 , has now been confirmed by dna as once belonging to king henry vii . the intricately-carved bed was left in the car park of the former hotel by builders who were renovating the property and , oblivious to its true value and historical significance , left it to be picked up by auctioneers . it was snapped up for £2,200 in 2010 by ian coulson , a four-poster bed specialist from northumberland who spotted the item , which was listed as 19th-century gothic revival , on the internet . however , he was shocked when his new ' victorian ' purchase arrived and approached tv historian jonathan foyle with a suspicion that the bed was , in fact , the only surviving tudor bed . since then , mr foyle has spent years trying to prove the artefact 's historical roots and has now revealed that dna testing on the bed 's timber proved it once belonged to king henry vii . he said tests confirmed it was european oak and of a sub-species ' typical of the origin of the finest , slow-grown oak imported by the medieval elites ' , with analysis of the historic paintwork proving its age . ' under the varnish , traces of late medieval decoration have been found , ' he said . he has traced it back to 1495 , when henry vii went to lathom in lancashire to see the stanley family , who had helped him to victory in the battle of bosworth in 1485 . mr foyle said dna from the bed 's timber proved it once belonged to king henry vii ( pictured ) and he traced it back to 1495 , when henry vii went to lathom in lancashire . henry viii may have been conceived in the bed . the bed was snapped up by ian coulson , a four-poster bed specialist from northumberland , for £2,200 in 2010 after it was dumped in the car park of the former redland house hotel in hough green , chester ( above ) . tv historian jonathan foyle has spent years trying to prove the artefact 's historical roots and has now revealed that dna testing on the bed 's timber proved the medieval furniture once belonged to king henry vii . he also discovered that the bed features an inscription from the matthew bible of 1537 - reading : ' the stinge of death is sinne . the strength of sinne is the lawe ' - which was added after 1547 , when england had a protestant monarch . the carving also features biblical scenes of henry and his wife elizabeth of york styled as adam and eve , and as jesus christ and his mother , the virgin mary and the figures are accompanied by medieval symbols of fertility , such as acorns , bunches of grapes and strawberries . meanwhile , scribblings in a victorian furniture restorer 's diary suggested that the bed was at lathom when it was damaged during a siege in 1644 . mr foyle said he had proved that the item was not the work of victorian revivalists by reflecting on the tudors ' belief that they had been chosen by god to save england from civil war . the bed features an inscription from the matthew bible of 1537 - reading : ' the stinge of death is sinne . the strength of sinne is the lawe ' - which was added after 1547 , when england had a protestant monarch . the bed also features carvings of biblical scenes of henry and his wife elizabeth of york styled as adam and eve , and as jesus christ and his mother , the virgin mary and the figures of medieval symbols of fertility . he said the headboard showed henry vii and his bride as adam and eve transmuted into christ - adding : ' it 's arguably the cradle of the english reformation . henry viii may have been conceived in bed . the carved four-poster bed , which has been revealed as henry viis , was reportedly created for the marriage of the first tudor king and his wife , elizabeth of york , on january 18 , 1486 . it is highly likely that the couple 's son , henry , was conceived in the bed - meaning the item may have a physical link to the beginning of the tudor dynasty . born at greenwich palace in 1491 , henry viii was the third child and second son of henry vii and his wife . only three of his six siblings survived infancy - and he succeeded his father as king following his death on 22 april , 1509 . under henry viii 's reign , england turned in favour of protestantism and split from rome , the royal navy built up a fleet of about 50 ships and the country invaded france . jonathan foyle , chief executive of world monuments fund britain , said : ' this bed belonged to henry viii . it has to be the most important piece of furniture [ in england ' - and arguably , royal artefact . ' he added : ' even the westminster coronation chair has less to say than this . ' experts believe henry vii may have taken the bed north while on a royal tour following the birth of his son . ' look how the king and queen represent themselves as manifestations of christ and mary ; it 's henry viii 's god complex in a nutshell . ' dr foyle described the 15th century artefact , which is considered one of the most valuable pieces of historical furniture in england , as ' a complete national treasure ' . he added : ' evidence suggests the bed was made for the painted chamber of westminster palace for the marriage ceremony at westminster abbey on january 18 , 1486 . ' mr foyle is backed by other experts , such as diarmaid macculloch , professor of the history of the church at oxford university , who described the rediscovery as ' exceptionally important ' . the medieval bed is now reportedly worth up to £20million , although it is currently not up for sale and is instead on public display . it is part of the ' a bed of roses ' exhibition at the childhood home of anne boleyn , henry viii 's second wife , at hever castle in kent which also features a portrait of henry viii as a young man . the bed is not the only historical royal artefact to have been discovered abandoned or hidden in england . in 2013 , the battle-scarred skeleton of richard iii was discovered by archaeologists in a car park in leicester . meanwhile , in december of the same year , archaeologists uncovered a site in the amazonian jungle believed to be the tomb of atahualpa , the last emporer of the incas . and last year , explorers found a piece of a pelvis that could belong to alfred the great in the grounds of hyde abbey in winchester . henry vii 's four-poster bed will remain on display in the long gallery at hever castle in kent until november 22 .	four-poster oak wood bed was dumped in the car park of redland house hotel in hough green , chester , by builders who were renovating the property it was snapped up for # 2,200 in 2010 by ian coulson , a four-poster bed specialist from northumberland who spotted the item , which was listed as 19th-century gothic revival since then , mr foyle has spent years trying to prove the artefact 's historical roots and has revealed that dna testing on the bed 's timber proved it once belonged to king henry vii	four - poster oak wood bed was dumped in the car park of redland house hotel in hough green , chester , by builders who were renovating the property . oblivious to its true value and historical significance , the construction workers dismantled the piece of oak wood furniture and left it to be picked up by auctioneers . dna testing on the bed ' s timber proved it once belonged to king henry vii , and he traced it to 1495 , when henry vii went to lathom in lancashire .	intricately-carved bed was left in car park of former redland house hotel in chester . builders were renovating the property when they dumped the bed . it was later sold at auction for # 2,200 by four-poster bed specialist ian coulson . tv historian jonathan foyle has spent years trying to prove artefact 's historical roots . dna testing on bed 's timber proves it once belonged to king henry vii .	intricately-carved bed was left in car park of former redland house hotel in chester . builders were renovating property and left it to be picked up by auctioneers . it was snapped up for £2,200 in 2010 by a four-poster bed specialist from northumberland . tv historian jonathan foyle has now confirmed it once belonged to king henry vii .	the intricately-carved ornate bed was left in the car park of redland house hotel in hough green , chester , by builders who were renovating the property builders dismantled the piece of oak wood furniture and left it to be picked up by auctioneers it was snapped up for # 2,200 in 2010 by ian coulson , a four-poster bed specialist from northumberland who spotted the item on the internet he was shocked when his new ` victorian ' purchase arrived and approached tv historian jonathan foyle with a suspicion that the bed was , in fact , the only surviving tudor bed mr foyle has traced it back to 1495 , when henry	the intricately - carved ornate bed was left in the car park of the former redland house hotel in hough green , chester .construction workers dismantled the piece of oak wood furniture and left it to be picked up by auctioneers .it was snapped up for £ 2,200 in 2010 by ian coulson , a four - poster bed specialist from northumberland who spotted the item , which was listed as 19th - century gothic revival , on the internet .

simon wood , 38 , from oldham won masterchef last friday . wannabe chefs with their eye on a career as the next gordon ramsay or jamie oliver should take note - it doesn't have to cost a fortune . the new winner of masterchef simon wood , who won the title last friday , has n't been on a single cookery course or even had one lesson . everything the 38 year old knows about cooking is self-taught - learnt form reading recipe books or watching television shows . he told mailonline : 'it’s all self-taught . there’s no more to it than that . you can achieve anything if you try hard enough and you’re passionate enough . ' i learnt what i know from reading , websites like youtube , watching tv and talking to people who are also passionate about it . ' i also found out a lot from watching chefs when i go to a restaurant - you go into a lot of restaurants these days and you can see straight into the kitchen . ' i can’t help it , it’s like watching tv and if it’s happening in front of you , you can’t help but watch what they do . ' while simon , who lives in oldham , learns about his cooking from reading and watching programmes , he sharpens his skills by practicing on his four children - liam , 20 , alex , 18 , cameron , 16 , and charlotte , seven . the lucky children are often on the receiving end of their father 's culinary masterpieces - in the wood household lunchboxes can become works of art . he said : ' they only get fancy stuff in their lunch boxes when i’m practising . ' all of my kids like different things , so it can be like a gourmet buffet sometimes when you’re at my house . ' everyone wants something different , someone wants fish , and someone else wants shellfish - if it’s in the fridge or freezer it’s likely to come out at some point or another . 'they’re not fussy at all though . they’re like me , there’s nothing i don’t like and that has carried on through to them too . it makes life a lot easier . ' scroll down for video . simon has always wanted to be a chef - when he was eight , he won the opportunity to spend a day in a hotel kitchen and featured in the local newspaper . but he gave up his dream because he and his wife , who he separated from two years ago , had a child very young . the couple met while working at mcdonalds and when he was just 19 , they had their first child - liam . simon as an eight year old after winning the chance to spend a day in a hotel kitchen . the hours that chefs do are notoriously antisocial and so simon decided to take up a career in it instead . his children are over the moon that their father is now following his dream though and they watched the masterchef final on tv together last friday , when they learnt for the first time that their father had won - because it had to be kept a secret until the programme aired . he said : ' when we watched it together , it was the first time that they found out i had won and it was emotional , it was pretty overwhelming . ' it was a moment in all of our lives that we’ll remember and will treasure and look back on . ' simon has come a long way since the beginning of the show - in the first episode he was so terrified that greg wallace , who is one of the judges on the show , pointed out that he was actually ' shaking in his trainers ' . simon said : ' when you first go in there on day one , when you see john and greg for the first time , they’re practically idols of yours and you’ve not met them before that . ' then it all starts to get very real very quickly . it’s a daunting prospect that’s in front of you . ' so the next hour and 15 minutes that you get in there can determine the rest of your life really . ' but simon managed to overcome his nerves and was noted as one of the contestants who had grown the most over the course of the show . he won the final with a starter of octopus , with chorizo crisps and a cannellini bean and chorizo salad ; his main course was pigeon with carrots , pommes parisienne and a cassis jus ; and for the pudding he produced a lemon posset , with citrus tutti-frutti . simon was noted as one of the contestants who had grown the most over the course of the show . he said : ' you grow so quickly when you’re down there . you get feedback from people that you’d never normally meet and they’re so good at what they do - everyone down there is . ' i got loads of really good feedback down there . i had a really good competition when i found my confidence and got rid of my nerves – i think it showed as well . ' for anyone looking to follow simon 's success , he has one simple tip - enjoy it . he said : ' if you don’t enjoy it , it shows in the food that you haven’t made something you believe in or enjoyed making . that comes out on the plate and ultimately for your guests or whoever is eating the meal and that’s no good because food is about passion and giving people a valuable experience . ' if you don’t enjoy it i don’t think your guests will either . ' simon has n't always been this good , even masterchef winner 's have the occasional cooking disaster . as a young man , he learnt the hazards of absent-minded cooking after he tipped and entire stock he had worked on for hours down the sink . he said : ' my biggest disaster was when i was younger and first started out cooking , i did christmas dinner for the first time . ' i had a big turkey carcass so thought i was going to make a really nice stock . ' i simmered it for hours and hours and made a really good stock . ' then i went to drain all of the vegetables and the bones out and ended up pouring it all down the sink because i didn’t put something under it , that was a lesson i learnt really early on – think about what you’re doing . ' i don’t think there is anything i can’t cook though . i think i’ve shown throughout the competition that i’m good with most things that get thrown at me . ' simon is now hoping to open a restaurant of his own . while he enjoys fancy cooking , one of the simplest culinary pleasures for simon is a meal that can be rustled up in under ten minutes - a plain omelette . he said : ' the first thing i ever cooked as a child was an omelette . ' and if i 'm looking for something quick and easy to do , i still always go back to an omelette and a glass of wine , with a salad . ' nothing in it , just some sea salt and a really good salad with it , that’s it – done . ' just nice and simple , good eggs , good omelette . ' but anyone looking to sample some of the cooking that netted simon the masterchef prize can expect something much more intricate when he succeeds in his dream of opening his own restaurant . for the time being he is going back to the it company he worked for , but his eye is already on setting up his own eaterie . he said : ' i am definitely planning on having a restaurant eventually – it’s every cook or chef’s dream . ' if you can make money doing something you love and enjoy it and help people create memories then that is amazing . ' i think a lot of people remember where they were when they had a good meal with special people at special times - if you can get involved with that by having a restaurant , it’s really good . ' i think i’d want to do classic dishes with a modern twist . ' something that looks nice , is achievable . but is also quite opulent and refined and nice . ' also something that isn’t out of everybody’s reach .

dundee united striker nadir ciftci celebrated a goal by blowing a kiss at opposition goalkeeper scott bain , but the turkish midfielder was the one left blushing as his side lost away at rivals dundee . former portsmouth ace ciftci briefly levelled the scores at dens park when he slotted home a penalty after greg stewart had given the hosts the lead . the 23-year-old celebrated by trying to rile dundee no 1 bain , but his actions came back to haunt him as the dark blues earned all three points thanks to further goals from jake mcpake and paul heffernan . dundee united striker nadir ciftci celebrated a goal by blowing a kiss at opposition goalkeeper scott bain . bain refuses to react as the turkish striker does his best to rile his rival goalkeeper at den park . turkish forward ciftci celebrates with a kiss but ends up blushing as his side lose derby match . it was dundee 's first win in a derby for more than 10 years and breathed further momentum into their push for a top-six place , as united 's poor run of domestic form continued . in front of a sell-out crowd , dundee started well with midfielder jim mcalister trying his luck early on with a 25-yard snap-shot on his left-foot which radoslaw cierzniak in the visitor’s goal held . united 's reply was a sweeping move involving paul dixon and chris erskine who , in turn , fed ciftci - but his low shot was saved by scott bain . jake mcpake wheels away in celebration as helps dundee earn first derby win in over a decade . however , dundee broke the deadlock in the 14th minute through stewart . the home side 's top scorer turned smartly and hit a shot from 22 yards which should have been dealt with by cierzniak , but the polish keeper allowed the ball to trickle through his hands and into the net , leaving him red-faced . the lead , however , was short-lived as united levelled two minutes later . chris erksine 's powerful shot came off the hand off dark blues skipper kevin thomson 's hand , and referee john beaton pointed straight to the spot . up stepped ciftci to send bain the wrong way and square things up . dundee utd goalkeeper radoslaw cierzniak looks back at his goal after mark stewart opened the scoring . stewart celebrates his derby goal with a fan as he runs over to the home faithful at den park . however , dundee regained the lead in the 23rd minute when stewart 's corner was met by mcpake , who rose above jaroslaw fojut head past cierzniak from six yards . as the half-hour mark approached , united came close to equalising when aidan connolly jinked in from the left before unleashing a venomous shot which bain was relieved to see clear his crossbar . the tangerines were desperate for an equaliser before the break and in the 35th minute dixon 's whipped cross was met by connolly - but his left-foot effort went wide . dundee utd 's chris erskine goes down under a challenge from stephen mcginn during the dundee derby . united attempted to step up a gear and john rankin 's 56th-minute shot was deflected just wide by stewart for a corner . at the other end , dundee 's paul mcgowan released paul mcginn down the right and his cross picked out heffernan - but the striker mishit the shot and the chance was not taken . however , heffernan was not to be denied and the irish ace killed the contest midway through the second half . dundee 's paul heffernan taps home his side 's third goal of the game as they close in on derby victory . skipper thomson sent stewart clear on the left and his cross was perfect for heffernan to calmly knock home at the far post . mcgowan almost made it 4-1with 10 minutes of the contest remaining , only for cierzniak to defy him with a fingertip save from his header . however , the hard work had already been done by the hosts - who were by far the better team on the night .	nadir ciftci scored the only goal of the game for dundee united in the 14th minute goalkeeper scott bain gave the hosts the lead after greg stewart had given dundee the lead jake mcpake and paul heffernan equalised for dundee in the second half united 's first win in a derby for more than 10 years and breathed further momentum into their push for a top-six place	nadir ciftci celebrated a goal by blowing a kiss at opposition goalkeeper scott bain . the former portsmouth ace slotted home a penalty after greg stewart had given the hosts the lead . it was dundee ' s first win in a derby for more than 10 years .	nadir ciftci celebrated a goal by blowing a kiss at opposition goalkeeper scott bain . greg stewart opened the scoring for dundee after chris erksine 's shot came off the hand of kevin thomson 's hand . dundee 's first derby win in over a decade . jake mcpake and paul heffernan scored for dundee .	nadir ciftci celebrated a goal by blowing a kiss at scott bain . but the turkish striker ended up blushing as dundee united lost . it was dundee's first win in a derby for more than 10 years .	nadir ciftci celebrated a goal by blowing a kiss at opposition goalkeeper scott bain but the turkish striker was the one left kissing as his side lose derby match it was dundee 's first win in a decade and breathes further momentum into their push for a top-six place	nadir ciftci celebrated a goal by blowing a kiss at opposition goalkeeper scott bain , but the turkish midfielder was the one left blushing as his side lost away at rivals dundee .the 23-year -

( cnn ) the victory of a 72-year-old former general , muhammadu buhari , in the nigerian elections represents a moment of maturity in west african politics . buhari , who some 30 years ago was nigeria 's harsh military leader , could of course prove to be a disaster ; so many self-described reformers have been . swath . but the peaceful transition of power from president goodluck jonathan to president buhari is the first of its kind in history . and the fact that the winner ran on an anti-corruption platform suggests that ordinary nigerians have finally had enough of the venality of their elites . for too long , nigeria 's poor have been victims of their country 's enormous wealth . the cancer of corruption has to be cut out . i visited nigeria in january and found a country under siege . abuja , the capital city , is where the rich have always imagined themselves making their last stand . soldiers guard the treacherous motorways ; houses are compounds covered in barbed wire . it 's a place where poor children rise at dawn to sift through the trash cans for food and black magic is practiced by the side of the road at dusk . yet thanks to nigeria 's oil , there is also tremendous wealth in abuja . and when you do n't really make money but simply take it from the soil and sell it , a crude kind of crony capitalism develops in which who you know is far more important than what you know . graft trickles down through the system ; through family , through patronage and through shady deals done with foreign businessmen at the 24-hour party palace at the abuja hilton hotel . the richest buy off the anger of the poorest , and vast swaths of society become complicit in the crime . for a while , that system brought some stability to the government of jonathan . but stability was contingent upon oil remaining at $ 110 a barrel , and in recent months the price has collapsed to below $ 50 a barrel . lacking funds , the government could no longer promise jobs to voters and had to start thinking creatively about serious economic development . one was the massive privatization of the power system , a sensible idea that promised to take energy provision out of the hands of a broken state and give it to businessmen to run . the problem is that costly investment and redevelopment did n't come soon enough : millions were left without power and the government 's few bold attempts at reform smacked of betrayal . the problem of corruption went hand-in-glove with the rise of terrorism . nigeria is not a natural , comfortable nation state ; it 's composed of many ethnicities and two major competing religions . the south is dominated by christians like jonathan , the north by muslims like buhari . and the north has witnessed a brutal , bloody terrorist insurgency led by boko haram , which translates as `` western education is forbidden . '' westerners might assume that boko haram 's major target is the christian south but , in fact , its war is as much against nonfundamentalist muslims as it is non-muslims , and its attacks have generally been focused on islamic population centers . failure to deal with this has not entirely been due to boko haram 's strategic ingenuity . previous administrations have simply been too dysfunctional to fight a war on terror . in 2010 , for instance , the government awarded a $ 470 million contract to provide security in abuja . few of the promised cameras were installed , yet the money was still paid in full . and soldiers sent to the front report being poorly equipped . the government is thought to have resorted to trying to purchase arms on the international black market , according to news reports -- although this is the kind of story that is hard to verify due to bans on granting visas to foreign journalists ( i was in nigeria as a consultant on a business visa ) . what is directly observable is that while the government proved capable of providing security in some areas , in others it utterly failed . and the jonathan government might have benefited from the boko haram terrorist emergency continuing in muslim centers , for the muslims were far more likely to vote for buhari . for buhari to win , he had to draw large numbers of votes in christian areas -- and there , again , a western prejudice is challenged . the victory of a muslim candidate in nigeria does not represent the victory of islamism , as we have so often been told by those skeptical of the ability of the muslim world to govern itself . on the contrary , buhari is associated with an earlier period in nigerian history when the army was relatively well paid and respected . he ran the country in the early 1980s along dictatorial lines , for sure . but he also ran a war against indiscipline when in power in which civil servants who were late to work were ordered to do frog jumps , drug dealers were publicly executed , and some 474 politicians and business were arrested on charges of corruption . buhari was removed in a coup , and he left office with the rare distinction of not having made very much money from it . now he has won the presidency promising to tackle those intertwined problems of boko haram and corruption . get the army functioning properly again , nigerians hope , and it will be able to drive back the fundamentalists . buhari has his critics , many of whom charge him with misrepresenting his cv and being a closet authoritarian . but they can not deny that he has won this historic victory because he has touched a chord with a people exhausted by years of misrule . you can only bribe the voters for so long before the squalor becomes too much to bear .	john avlon : nigeria 's poor have been victims of their country 's enormous wealth avlon : the government could no longer promise jobs to voters and had to start thinking creatively about serious economic development he says the government 's plan to take energy provision out of the hands of a broken state and give it to businessmen to run	muhammadu buhari , 72 , was nigeria ' s harsh military leader some 30 years ago . he was elected to president buhari ' s anti - corruption platform . buhari : " ordinary nigerians have had enough of the venality of their elites " . the problem of corruption went hand - in - glove with the rise of terrorism , he says .	former general muhammadu buhari won the nigerian elections on an anti-corruption platform . jonathan 's government has been plagued by corruption , writes anthony ogunleslesles . he says buhari 's election represents a moment of maturity in west african politics .	muhammadu buhari's victory in the nigerian elections represents a moment of maturity in west african politics . the fact that the winner ran on an anti-corruption platform suggests that ordinary nigerians have finally had enough of the venality of their elites .	muhammadu buhari , 72 , was nigeria 's harsh military leader 30 years ago but the peaceful transition of power from president goodluck jonathan to president buhari is the first of its kind in history ogunlesi : for too long , nigeria 's poor have been victims of their country 's enormous wealth	nigeria 's poor children rise at dawn to sift through the trash cans for food and black magic is practiced by the side of the road at dusk .soldiers guard the treacherous motorways ; houses are compounds covered in barbed wire .

residents living yards from the scene of the £60million hatton garden heist have revealed how they were hit by ' peculiar ' power cuts on the weekend before the daring crime . they also claim to have heard ‘drilling’ noises on the evening of good friday , but thought at the time that this was simply a continuation of road works that had been taking place in recent weeks . meanwhile it has also been alleged that the thieves returned a day after the initial robbery in central london to steal more loot after becoming ' greedy ' . scroll down for video . arrival : two members of the criminal gang , with their faces obscured , can be seen entering the building . leaving the area : later on , they exit the building with wheelies bins thought to be carrying the stolen loot . scotland yard admitted last week that an alarm first went off at the scene after midnight on good friday , but it was graded as ' no police response was deemed to be required ' . residents on greville street - near the scene close to farringdon station - say they had suspicious power outages a full week before the heist , which they now think could be linked . farhana begum , 19 , who lives in a flat just a ten-second walk from the raided premises , added : ‘ my mum actually heard drilling on the [ good ] friday night , it was probably about 9pm or 9.30pm . ‘ but there had been road works , or construction work , going on in the street for the last couple of weeks , so she thought that they may have been working late . protection : one of the gang members carries a large plastic bag past the camera to help obscure his face . vehicle : a white transit van used to transport the gang and their loot pulls away from outside the building . ‘ but she did think it was quite weird that they would be drilling at that time . also , about two weeks ago , so the weekend before it happened , there was an electrical cut . ' miss begum added : ‘ it was over that weekend , so before the holborn fire [ under kingsway on april 1 ] as well . it happened on either the friday or the saturday , it was just a bit peculiar . ’ career criminal : noel ' razor ' smith , who has 58 convictions and spent 32 years in prison , said the group was likely brought together by a ' mr big ' . another local resident , data scientist john han , 26 , said : ‘ we heard some type of loud noise which woke us up . it was late at night on the friday or saturday . i ca n't remember which . ‘ i heard some type of noise . i 'm not sure what it was , but i thought they were just doing road works in the street again . but i did think to myself why would somebody be doing road works at that time ? ’ former bank robber noel ' razor ' smith - who was responsible for more than 200 bank robberies during his criminal career - believes the group made an unplanned return to the scene after their initial break-in when they realised their robbery had not been discovered . mr smith , speaking after having analysed video footage of the raid , told the daily mirror the organised criminals would be aware of the huge risk involved in returning for more spoils , but the rewards outweighed the danger . on saturday night , police released dramatic cctv images of the raid in the hope of a breakthrough in the investigation . the pictures show the robbers at work over several days as they take part in the raid on the basement packed with security boxes in london 's diamond district . described as ' highly audacious ' by metropolitan police detectives , the men - wearing adidas tracksuits , builders ' hats and high-visibility jackets - were captured entering the building through a side exit , before leaving hours later with a wheelie bin full of jewels . the gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault . the group left the jewellers on good friday after having first appeared on camera the day before . but one of the thieves then reappeared on camera late saturday night - a move mr smith described as a ' huge risk ' . saturday , march 28 . thursday , april 2 . friday , april 3 . saturday , april 4 . sunday , april 5 . tuesday , april 7 . mr smith told reporter david collins , writing for the daily mirror : ' he could be out the country by now spending the rest of his life a very rich man . instead he 's come back for more . ' i do n't think this was part of the plan . but criminals are greedy . ' mr smith went on to state the raid was likely organised by a ' mr big ' who organised an elite crew made up of europeans and israelis , unknown to each other , acting on his inside information . cctv shows the gang of at least six men breaking into a basement side door at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd building . it is now known they then took stairs to the second floor , disabled a lift and abseiled down the shaft to get to the vault , avoiding security doors . the footage is from the bottom of a fire escape by the basement side door . at 9.23pm on the thursday , just minutes after employees left for the easter bank holiday weekend , a red-haired man wearing a baseball cap was the first to arrive and headed downstairs to the vault . a street camera then picked up a white ford transit van drawing up outside and men were seen dragging wheelie bins away before the van left . the men , wearing high-visibility jackets and hard hats , carried large holdalls and dragged the wheelie bins downstairs towards the vault . it is thought that one of the bins contained the 77lb drill used to bore through the 6ft-thick vault wall . on good friday , at 7.51am the raiders emerged through the basement side door with holdalls , tools and the bins , now believed to be filled with diamonds , cash and jewellery . the van was seen pulling up again before the men loaded it and drove off . at 10.17pm on saturday , the cameras showed three of the men returning with holdalls and tool boxes . from 5.46am on sunday , the gang went back and forth four times with a wheelie bin from the vault to the van . they then loaded up the van and drove off at 6.44am . in total , 72 safety deposit boxes were opened out of 999 boxes in the vault . possible identities suggested for the thieves have ranged from russian gangsters to former serbian military personnel , or that they are part of the ' pink panther gang ' from the balkans . scotland yard was branded as ' incompetent ' last week after admitting it got a call at 0.20am on the friday from a company who monitors alarms across the south east , but instead of acting on it , deemed it ' no police response required ' . a police spokesman said : ' the call stated that a confirmed intruder alarm had been activated at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd . ' the call was recorded and transferred to the police 's ( computer ) system . a grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required . ' he added : ' we are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call . this investigation is being carried out locally . it is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident . ' in response to whether officers had spoken to residents about the power cuts and ' drilling ' noises , a police spokesman declined to comment . meanwhile , a ukip candidate who is under investigation for handing out sausage rolls to voters has revealed that he may have lost valuables in the hatton garden burglary . kim rose , a jeweller who is standing in the southampton itchen constituency in hampshire , had a box at the safe deposit hit in the raid . the 58-year-old made headlines last week when it emerged that police want to question him after a report that he tried to woo potential voters with refreshments at a party event . mr rose is still waiting to hear whether his was among 72 boxes which were taken in the burglary and will be interviewed by police tomorrow morning over the sausage roll claims . where were the gang from ? speculation over the gang’s origin has been feverish . possible identities put forward have ranged from former serbian military personnel to russian gangsters , or that they are members of the so-called pink panther gang from the balkans , who have carried out robberies across europe . however , the pink panthers have been violent and aggressive in the past , which was not the case here . an accomplice on the inside ? the men reached the fire exit through an alley leading from a side street in hatton garden , but this alley is protected by a metal gate and the raiders would have needed a key . furthermore , there was no sign of a forced entry through the fire exit door into the company’s premises , indicating they had a key or that someone had let them in from the inside . another theory is that a member of the gang had rented a space within the premises . loot smuggled out of the country ? some believe the haul was stolen to order for the middle eastern market . whoever their buyer , it is agreed by police , former robbers and crime experts that the gems are likely to have already left the country - and probably very soon after the raid . according to one former robber quoted in a newspaper at the weekend , getting the goods out of the country would be ‘ a doddle’ . what about the ‘ king of diamonds’ ? a criminal mastermind known as the ' king of diamonds ' was named last week among the prime suspects . the only known picture of the mysterious robber comes from an unsolved raid on a knightsbridge 's graff diamond store in 2007 . the panama hat-wearing raider entered the exclusive shop after jumping out of a chauffeur-driven bentley . he and an accomplice then pulled out guns and made off with £13million worth of jewellery .	residents claim they heard ` drilling ' noises on the evening of good friday but they also claim they were hit by ` peculiar ' power cuts on the weekend scotland yard said it was graded as ` no police response was deemed to be required ' it has also been alleged that thieves returned a day after the robbery	residents on greville street say they were hit by ' peculiar ' power cuts . they also claim to have heard ' drilling ' noises on the evening of good friday . but they thought this was a continuation of road works that had been taking place . scotland yard admitted last week that an alarm first went off at the scene . but it was graded as ' no police response was deemed to be required ' .	residents claim to have heard ` drilling ' noises on the evening of good friday . thought at the time that this was simply a continuation of road works . scotland yard admitted last week that an alarm went off at the scene after midnight on good friday . but it was graded as ` no police response was deemed to be required ' residents on greville street say they had suspicious power outages a full week before the heist .	residents say they were hit by 'peculiar' power cuts a week before the heist . they also claim to have heard 'drilling' noises on good friday evening . but they thought this was a continuation of road works in recent weeks . it has also been alleged that the thieves returned a day after the heist to steal more loot .	residents living yards from the scene of the # 60million heist have revealed how they were hit by ` peculiar ' power cuts on the weekend before the daring crime they also claim to have heard ` drilling ' noises on the evening of good friday , but thought it was a continuation of road works that had been taking place in recent weeks meanwhile it has also been alleged that the thieves returned a day after the initial robbery in central london to steal more loot after becoming ` greedy '	scotland yard admitted last week that an alarm first went off at the scene after midnight on good friday , but thought at the time that this was simply a continuation of road works that had been taking place in recent weeks .meanwhile it has also been alleged that the thieves returned a day after the initial robbery in central london to steal more loot after becoming ' greedy ' .residents on greville street say they had suspicious power outages a full week before the heist , which they now think could be linked .

a sicilian mafia fugitive dubbed the godfather of uxbridge who was set to be extradited to italy will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence was dropped . domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra . in february he lost his year-and-a-half battle against extradition and was told he must return to italy to serve his sentence . but today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn . sentence dropped : domenico rancadore ( right and left ) fled to britain in the 1990s and was convicted in his absence in italy for his role as a ' man of honour ' . although his conviction remains intact , italian law states that a sentence is extinguished once a period of more than double the time of the penalty has passed . the case will still have to be heard by the italian supreme court , according to the crown prosecution service ( cps ) . rancadore 's solicitor , karen todner said : ' yesterday the italian court of appeal agreed to extinguish the conviction of domenico rancadore on the basis that the conviction is too old to sustain a prison sentence . ' i am therefore confident that the italian government will now withdraw their application for a european arrest warrant and that mr rancadore will be discharged from these proceedings . ' there has been a long and unhappy history of these proceedings and i am delighted mr rancadore will now be able to live in peace in england with his wife and family . ' ms todner said she was waiting for the cps to sign a consent order so that the court could discharge rancadore . once the paperwork is in order , the matter will be listed at westminster magistrates ' court in london and a judge will then have to approve it . the italian mobster does not have to be present when the matter is dealt with in court . domenico rancadore , pictured with hiswife ann last year , will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence dropped . rancadore was first arrested on a european arrest warrant at his semi-detached london home in august 2013 . although he was never convicted of murder , the italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country after he fled in 1995 . known as the professor , rancadore was tried in absentia and handed a seven-year prison term for his ' mafia association ' . he was convicted for his role as a ' man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders in palermo . during protracted extradition proceedings at westminster magistrates ' court , district judge howard riddle reversed his initial decision over concerns that italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition . in his judgment , judge riddle said : ' i am satisfied that , even without the assurance , there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment . ' before his arrest in 2013 , the mafia don spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge , obscured from view . he claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father , giuseppe . rancadore 's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 mafiosi indicted . before his arrest in 2013 , rancadore spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house in uxbridge . there was an angry reaction from legal experts to the amount of time and money that had gone into rancadore 's case . extradition expert edward grange tweeted : ' what a waste of time and money . after two sets of proceedings , italy no longer seeks extradition of rancadore . ' mr grange , who is vice-chair of the extradition lawyers ' association , said : ' the purpose of the extradition request was for rancadore to be returned in order to serve a sentence of imprisonment . ' it transpires that as of october last year the italians could not actually legally enforce that sentence . ' so certainly from october onwards you would have thought that there would have been some communication from the italian authorities saying : `` hang on , we may have a problem here and we may not be able to continue with the extradition request '' . ' courts proceed on the basis of mutual trust and recognition , that is what we are told throughout in relation to the extradition and european arrest warrant scheme . ' it is something that is designed to be swift and quick and courts are supposed to trust what courts in the requesting state are saying . ' had the italians said in october we can not legally enforce this sentence and we therefore have to withdraw the european arrest warrant , i 'm sure our court would have encouraged them to do so as quickly as possible . ' domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra . asked about the costs of this kind of extradition process , mr grange said they were likely to be in the 'single-figure thousands rather than anything dramatic ' . barrister philip marshall qc said : ' yet more incompetence by the cps in the rancadore case ( allegedly ) : his seven-year prison sentence expired in october 2014 . ' there was no answer when reporters knocked on the door of rancadore 's home in manor way , uxbridge , london today . curtains were closed in all of the windows of the semi-detached house and a mercedes car was parked on the driveway . one neighbour claimed she was pleased it appeared he was not being extradited because ' you never know who will move in ' . she went on : ' he seems a nice chap and it happened a long time ago . ' the neighbour said she last saw rancadore around two weeks ago and he appeared to be suffering from ill-health . a court sketch of domenico rancadore . today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn . sharon walker , who also lives nearby , said : ' they were a normal couple before and i 'm sure they will go back to being a normal couple . ' they are very quiet . i would not have said they are the most notorious couple in the street . also known as cosa nostra , which translates as ' our thing ' , the mafia emerged in sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct . groups , often known as families or clans , will claim leadership of an area , usually a town or village , and operate rackets within it , using violence to punish those causing problems to their ' clients ' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection . most of the clans are led by a ' boss ' ( capofamiglia or rappresentante ) , who is aided by an underboss ( capo bastone or sotto capo ) and supervised by one or more advisers ( consigliere ) . only men are allowed to join the clans , and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges . it has been estimated that the sicilian mafia costs the region 's economy more than €10 billion a year , and that roughly 70 per cent of sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money . politicians have also been accused of using the mafia to buy votes during elections . the american mafia arose from offshoots of the cosa nostra that emerged in the united states during the late nineteenth century , following waves of emigration from italy . ' he 's very quiet . he always has been , even before it all blew up . they are a very quiet family . ' federico bianchi , head of press at the italian embassy , said : ' when , in march 2014 , the district judge denied the extradition of mr rancadore to italy , the crown prosecution service failed to appeal against his decision in the prescribed terms , for which they issued a formal excuse . ' that is key to the release of mr rancadore because that loss of time , which obliged italy to start the procedures afresh , issuing a new european arrest warrant , because that year that was lost gave the possibility for the sentence to expire . ' it gave the possibility to mr rancadore 's lawyers , who are clever and know the penal code very well , to file an application for the sentence to be declared expired . ' mr bianchi also denied that the hearing in february had been ' useless ' because the sentence had not automatically expired until it was confirmed as such by a court in palermo on march 25 . a cps spokesman said : ' the italian ministry of justice has confirmed that the decision by the court of appeal in palermo is appealable to the italian supreme court . ' it is inaccurate to suggest that a delay due to administrative errors has had a significant bearing on today 's outcome . ' until the european arrest warrant was officially withdrawn today , the cps acted on behalf of the italian authorities in these extradition proceedings and had received no instructions to the contrary . ' the cps admitted it had made a mistake by failing to serve appeal papers to rancadore 's lawyers on time in march last year . at the time , director of public prosecutions alison saunders acknowledged that , as a result of the error , it was possible rancadore would never be extradited to italy .	domenico rancadore was set to be extradited to italy for his role as a ` man of honour ' the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn his conviction remains intact , italian law states that a sentence is extinguished once a period of more than double the time of the penalty has passed rancadore 's solicitor karen todner said : ` there has been a long and unhappy history of these proceedings and i am delighted mr rancadore will now be able to live in peace in england with his wife and family '	domenico rancadore , 65 , fled to italy in the 1990s and was convicted in his absence for his role as a ' man of honour ' . he was sentenced to seven years in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra . but in february he was told he must return to italy to serve his sentence . but today it emerged that his case expired and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn .	domenico rancadore was convicted of being a member of the cosa nostra in 1999 . the 65-year-old fled to britain in the 1990s and was convicted in his absence . he was due to be extradited to italy in february but lost his year-and-a-half battle against extradition . today it emerged his case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn .	domenico rancadore, 65, was convicted in his absence in italy in 1999 . he was convicted for his role as a 'man of honour' in the cosa nostra . rancadore fled to britain in the 1990s and was convicted in his absence . he was sentenced to seven years in prison but his case expired last october . today it emerged his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn .	domenico rancadore was convicted in his absence in italy in 1999 he was given a seven-year sentence for being a member of the cosa nostra in february he lost his year-and-a-half battle against extradition and was told he must return to italy to serve his sentence today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn	domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven - year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra .but today it emerged that the 65-year - old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn .italian law states that a sentence is extinguished once a period of more than double the time of the penalty has passed .

an old bailey judge has blasted his junior colleague for ‘ taking his eye off the ball’ and passing an ' unlawful ' sentence when letting a bt manager dodge jail for a £28,000 expenses scam . wheelchair-bound christopher starrs , 50 , was allowed to go free from court with just a suspended jail sentence in january after admitting his part in a two-and-a-half year con against his employer bt . starrs , along with fellow bt openreach manager phillip tamplin , invented clamped cars , overtime hours and damage to home owners’ property during broadband installation , and paid off engineers to help them make the fake claims . blasted : judge nicholas cooke qc ( left ) blasted his junior colleague recorder stuart trimmer qc ( right ) for ' taking his eye off the ball ' when he sentenced christopher starrs in january this year . both starrs and tamplin , 53 , who made £124,000 from the con , admitted submitting the string of bogus expenses . tamplin was jailed for two years at january 's sentencing hearing , but mr recorder stuart trimmer qc spared starrs jail as an ‘ act of mercy’ - although he ordered him to repay the money he took and pay a £1,500 fine . however , senior judge nicholas cooke qc has now said the sentence was ‘unlawful’ - and added starrs should have been sent to prison for his crimes . ‘ it was an unlawful sentence passed and now i need to do something to put it right , because it was negligence on the parties involved in the matter , ’ he said . ‘ he was mercifully dealt with , sadly by a judge who didn’t have his eye on the ball . ’ the judge told mark haslam , defending : ‘ the sentence was wrong but that’s a matter of personal opinion . ‘ your client was fortunate to not go straight to prison . ‘ what the recorder did was to impose a package of sentencing options that wasn’t available to him . ‘ no one appears to have noticed that the sentencing imposed on mr starrs was unlawful . ‘ i am sorry to be the headmaster but we really don’t want this sort of thing . ’ fraud : wheelchair-bound starrs , 50 , was a manager with bt who admitted defrauding the company of £28,000 over two years . the recorder , who is the head of 4 bream buildings chambers and took the silk in 2006 , gave starrs a 16-month jail sentence suspended for two years and ordered to pay a fine , and allowed the confiscation proceeds to continue . but judge cooke said it was not possible to imposed a financial penalty at the same time as postponing a confiscation order . turning his fire on the barristers who were at the sentencing hearing , he added : ‘ this is supposed to be a centre of excellence , when you expect the representatives to point out what we can and can’t do . ‘ the judge should have been told what his powers were . ’ prosecutor john ojakovoh said starrs offered a ‘ blank cheque’ at sentencing and has already paid back the £28,000 he stole . after the judge heard the cps will now drop the confiscation proceedings , he said the original sentence will stand , quipping : ‘ he no doubt thanks his lucky stars . ’ both barristers admitted they had failed to spot the sentencing blunder at the time . the main fraudulent claim was for bt vehicles which had been ‘clamped’ by parking authorities . bt openreach workers are allowed to claim back parking tickets on expenses as they are regularly forced to park their vans illegally to carry out their work . the company pays out around £1million in fines in london alone every year . starrs and tamplin used an authentic clamping ticket to reproduce reams of duplicates . sentencing recorder trimmer , who has led a string of high-profile serious fraud office prosecutions in the last two years , said : ‘ this was a sophisticated fraud perpetrated over a very long period of time . ‘ it involved over 100 or so false claims , made within the context of a large organisation that was open to fraudulent activity . ‘ both of you were in the position of managers within that organisation and both well knew how open the organisation was to fraudulent activity . ‘ you both knew how it could be conducted , concealed and be made to benefit each of you personally . ’ starrs , of northolt , middlesex , who had worked at bt since 1988 , was excused from sitting in the dock because he is in a wheelchair . he was not at court today due to a mix-up over whether he was required to attend .	christopher starrs , 50 , was allowed to go free from court with just a suspended jail sentence in january judge nicholas cooke qc blasted his junior colleague for ` taking his eye off the ball ' and passing an ` unlawful ' sentence when letting a bt manager dodge jail for a # 28,000 expenses scam starrs and fellow bt openreach manager phillip tamplin invented clamped cars , overtime hours and damage to home owners ' property during broadband installation	christopher starrs , 50 , was allowed to go free from court with just a suspended jail sentence in january after admitting his part in a two -

' for perry who also is a judge on australia 's next top model , this also will include more work in tv overseas . he has currently filmed production for asia’s next top model which is said to broadcast to over 11 million homes in asia and middle east via the star world network and he 's also looking into more tv opportunities there but ca n't go into the specifics yet . model mogul : perry with alessandra ambrosio ( left ) who guest stars in this year 's australia 's next top model . from a-list to asia : perry has just filmed asia 's next top model and plans to work on more tv projects in asia . as for his fashion empire , perry believes despite his work in tv , as well as linen and specsaver lines , fashion is his first and foremost love and while he admits he wo n't stop at one thing , everything has to have synergy with his fashion brand . ' tv stuff gets a lot of press , but in reality i’m a fashion designer and it’s all about the credibility of clothes , so i’m really focused on that because that propels everything else .

( cnn ) two cnn heroes are among the earthquake survivors in kathmandu , nepal . and they are struggling in the aftermath . anuradha koirala , who rescues victims of sex trafficking , has a rehabilitation center in kathmandu that is home to 425 young women and girls . while her primary facility seems structurally unharmed , all of the children have been sleeping outdoors because of aftershocks , followed by a second earthquake on may 12 . the once-vibrant campus has gone from a place of safety and healing to one of uncertainty and worry . `` we are suffering with rain , strong wind . the fear is not gone from us . it is very , very hard , '' said koirala , the founder of the nonprofit maiti nepal and the 2010 cnn hero of the year . the public has been warned not to use the main water line due to risk of cholera . koirala 's group is relying on bottled water and is now rationing food . still , she has offered to take in 200 other girls orphaned by the disaster . `` these girls are most vulnerable , because now people will target them , '' koirala said . `` they could be victims of any forms of sexual abuse . maybe rape , maybe they will be trafficked , anything . ... if i get more support i will take as many as i can . '' about five miles away , the wall of koirala 's hiv/aids hospice has crumbled . home to 115 girls , many of whom are terminally ill , the facility is under guard . `` they 're not injured , but they are terrified , '' koirala said . `` everything is broken in the hospice . '' koirala 's group also has about a dozen other homes throughout the district , and all of them have been damaged . `` it 's really very sad for me and for my children , '' koirala said . `` this disaster , the noise and the way it shook , i can not get over it . i was not afraid that i was going to be killed . i was afraid about what is going to happen next . '' another cnn hero , pushpa basnet , and the 45 children she cares for were also forced to evacuate their residence . they are now living on the ground in a nearby field . `` physically , we are not hurt . but mentally , we are , '' said basnet , whose early childhood development center provides a home and education to children whose parents are incarcerated . basnet says the building 's walls are all cracked , and the staff is afraid it might fall down . she and the older children created a shelter using the frame of a greenhouse , taping plastic around the sides to protect themselves . `` it 's really cold in the middle of the night ; there are lots of fox in the field , '' basnet said . `` we are really scared .

her neighbour’s leylandii hedge stands 40ft tall and , says audrey alexander , has left parts of her garden in deep shade . what’s more , it now seems likely to remain that way . despite a 35-year fight to get the trees cut down to size , the council has ruled they can stay . it is the final defeat in a battle that involved two generations of mrs alexander’s family . it kicked off 35 years ago when mrs alexander’s aunt found her vegetable patch at the property would not grow anything worth eating because of the leylandii . a row between neighbours over a 40ft high leylandii hedge ( pictured ) has finally come to and end after 35 years . the battle between the neighbouring properties started in 1980 when the owner planted a vegetable patch which withered and died in the shade of her neighbour 's massive hedge . then , 23 years ago , single mother mrs alexander bought the house and asked her neighbour jeanette robinson to trim the hedge . she claims mrs robinson refused and declared : ‘ i would rather move than touch these trees . ’ the dispute rumbled on , with mrs alexander , 54 , claiming that the trees knocked £20,000 off the value of her property . she sensed an opportunity , however , with the passing of the high hedge act in scotland in 2013 which allows local authorities to take action in such cases . stirling council has finally ruled that the hedge can stay , despite claims it has knocked £20,000 off the value of neighbour audrey alexander 's house ( pictured ) . the situation came to a head in 2008 , when a 65ft section of hedge is said to have fallen and demolished a neighbour 's garden shed . audrey alexander ( pictured ) also claims other neighbours have had to move their children from their bedrooms at night for fear of the falling branches . but her council has ruled that mrs robinson can keep the hedge , although it has to be cut to 20ft . mrs alexander said the ruling made ‘ no difference’ . the high hedge act 2013 allows neighbours to complain to the council when a hedgerow blocks sunlight from reaching their garden . complainants and the hedge 's owner are encouraged to resolve the issue between themselves and councils should only be called in to help as a last resort . because the effect the hedge has is not always clear , disputes can last for years before an agreement can be reached . the local authority can either issue a high hedge notice , which orders owners to cut the hedge back , or decide not to act . the local authority can not make any orders about the roots of the hedge . she added : ‘ the whole situation is appalling – the legislation is about giving people the right to sunlight . ‘it’s a disgrace and i feel extremely let down . ’ the neighbour refused to comment . mrs alexander’s only option is the courts which she can not afford to do . over the years she had used the mediation services of stirling district council to try to resolve the issue . the situation came to a head in 2008 , when she claims a 65ft section of hedge fell , demolishing a neighbour’s garden shed . following the introduction of the high hedge act , stirling council found in her favour but the neighbour appealed and won the 20ft ruling . dr colin watson , of scothedge , a group which demands the end of ‘ high hedge tyranny’ , said that the council’s decision was ‘ pretty crazy’ . a council spokesman said the decision was made ‘ after carrying out a site inspection and considering all the evidence’ . mrs alexander said her aunt , now 87 , had moved to france to enjoy ‘ sunshine and gardening’ . ms alexander called in stirling district council to try to solve the quarrel , but no solution could be found and the feud continued . the council ruled that the hedge should be cut to about 20ft , a height which ms alexander claims will still block most of her sunlight .	audrey alexander , 54 , has left parts of her garden in deep shade her neighbour 's hedge kicked off 35 years ago when mrs alexander 's aunt found her vegetable patch at the property would not grow anything worth eating the dispute rumbled on , with mrs alexander claiming the trees knocked #

a married couple who thought they would never be able to have children are celebrating after welcoming triplets - born three years apart thanks to ivf . denise and glen higgs , from braunton , devon , had all but lost hope that they would ever be able to conceive after glen was made infertile due to cancer treatment . but using his frozen sperm , doctors successfully created eight embryos through ivf fertility treatment and the couple had a daughter mazy , born three years ago . louise and glen higgs with daughter mazy , aged three and newborns carson alan ( left ) and carter joel ( right ) . the couple tried again using the same batch and denise gave birth to twins carter and carson last week . former raf fireman glen said : ' medical staff have told us our three children are triplets as they are all from the batch of embryos that were created at the same time . ' it is crazy really - seeing as there are three-and-half years between them in age . ' glen , 35 , had always wanted to have children and decided to store sperm shortly before his testicular cancer treatment at the age of 20 made him infertile . he met dee and , after living together for five years , tied the knot in 2011 before embarking on a course of ivf treatment . carter joel higgs ( white top ) and carson alan higgs ( blue top ) who were born on march 24 2015 weighing 5lb 12oz and 5lb 5oz , with ivf triplet sister mazy linda higgs , aged three . glen said : ' i had an unusual tumour growing within the testicle . after all my treatment , they tested my sperm and they were non-swimmers . ' i knew then that if i ever wanted to have children i would have to go through ivf . ' i had always wanted kids and first went through the process with dee in 2010 . we got funding for the first try and got lucky when mazy was born . ' glen , now a manager at a filter-making factory , said : ' we then just had to wait and see if it attaches okay . we ended up having eight embryos . ' we put two in to attempt to have a child the first time and froze the other six . ' we were talking about getting rid of them - as we were paying a yearly storage fee - but decided to try again . we had to fund it ourselves this time and put two in again . ' amazingly they both stuck and we have ended up with two more beautiful babies . ' i always wanted to have kids and am a big family man . the process we went through was hard but we could not have asked more from the final outcome . ' i am the happiest man ever . i have three healthy kids when i thought i would never have any . one we thought would be amazing - to have three is an unbelievable gift .

' we were so happy though . it has been a huge change in our lives but we have just learnt to adapt . ' going through ivf is one of the hardest things you ever have to go through as a woman . ' the whole process is horrendous , but as we have proved it does actually work . ' there are so many injections and medication and it can be very undignified at times . i did get very emotional at times but i have no regrets at all about doing it .

stevie mccrorie has been crowned the winner of the voice uk 2015 , after beating fellow contestant lucy o'byrne in the final . now mentor ricky wilson , his fellow celebrity judges rita ora , tom jones and will.i.am , and most of all bosses at the bbc will all have their fingers crossed for his success . because it 's not just a hit single stevie needs , he also has to break the curse of previous winners who have failed to do anything but flop out of the charts . scroll down for video . can this year 's the voice uk champion stevie mccrorie break the winners ' curse ? his mentor ricky wilson is confident stevie could be just what the bbc needs to pull their talent show out of ridicule . leanne mitchell , the first ever winner of the voice uk , has been dropped by her record label and now works as a holiday camp performer . the very job she was hoping to leave behind when first auditioning for the show . series one winner leanne mitchell , mentored to success in 2012 by sir tom jones , blew everyone away with her version of whitney houston 's i would run to you in the live final . but despite much excitement surrounding her first single , she failed to rank any higher than number 45 in the music charts . then a year later came her album , a record of songs written entirely by her rather than a compilation of cover versions , which failed to chart in the top 100 . some , including the script frontman and former voice coach danny o'donoghue , believe leanne did n't have the right work ethic . when asked last year about leanne 's flop , he said , ' i was told by tom jones , and by the label as well , that leanne just did not want to work as hard as you have to work to be a pop star . ' leanne won the public vote in the final of the voice uk 's first ever series , but her debut single , a cover of whitney houston 's i would run to you only just managed to scrape into the top 50 after being released . leanne mitchell has now returned to her previous employment , singing for holiday campers at potters leisure resort in hopton-on-sea , norfolk , after failing to make her mark on the music industry . after being dropped by her label decca , leanne is now working in the job she thought she 'd left behind - singing for holiday campers at potters leisure resort in hopton-on-sea , norfolk . the singer has defended her efforts , suggesting that she was given poor advice and not enough support once she 'd finished writing her album . but can the same be said for series two winner , andrea begley ? former the voice uk coach danny o'donoghue criticised leanne mitchell for not working hard enough after winning series one of the bbc talent show , but has failed to make his own winning act , andrea begley , who was crowned champion of the second series in 2013 , into a household name either . partially sighted irish singer andrea was determined to avoid the mistakes of her predecessor leanne , but despite enjoying more chart success amd holding onto her record deal , she too has failed to equal the superstardom that comes with winning other tv talent shows like simon cowell 's the x factor . the partially sighted singer from pomeroy , northern ireland , now 29 , won the public vote in 2013 after being mentored by fellow irishman , danny . she even commented on the failings of her predecessor leanne , and said that she was determined to do things differently . ' everybody is obviously aware that last year things did n't go maybe as well as they could 've done , and i think lessons have been learned , ' she told the mirror , shortly after being crowned champ . andrea 's album , the message , released in october 2013 did make it to number seven in the album charts , but compare that to the success of most x factor winners , and you soon understand the singer 's disappointment . but while andrea is still fortunate enough to have herself a record deal , her success has n't been the chart topping megastardom that winning a rival show like the x factor might bring . her debut single , a cover of evanescence 's my immortal , charted at number 30 , while her follow up , dancing in the dark , originally by bruce springsteen , did n't make it any further than 113 . andrea 's album , the message , released in october 2013 did make it to number seven in the album charts , but compare that to the success of most x factor winners , and you soon understand the deflation in the begley camp . will.i.am won the third series of the voice uk with jermain jackman , a young singer from hackney , london . 2014 the voice winner jermain saw his debut single and i am telling you , a cover of the broadway number made famous by jennifer hudson in musical dreamgirls , chart at just number 75 . hot on the heels of andrea was jermain jackman , who won last year 's series with coach will.i.am . if a slow start killed leanne mitchell 's chances , jermain and will had better kick this career into gear . the singer from hackney in london , still just 20-years-old , saw his debut single and i am telling you , a cover of the broadway number made famous by jennifer hudson in musical dreamgirls , chart at number 75 . despite various public appearances , once with mitch winehouse at a charity event in the name of his late daughter amy winehouse , jermain 's debut album this month has landed at number 42 . compared with x factor 's 2014 winner ben haenow , whose debut single landed the christmas number one spot , jermain 's success has so far been what you could call limited . compared with x factor 's 2014 winner ben haenow , whose debut single landed the christmas number one spot , jermain 's success has so far been what you could call limited . despite various public appearances , once with mitch winehouse ( pictured centre ) at a charity event in the name of his late daughter amy winehouse , jermain 's debut album this month has landed at number 42 . the glitter falls from the ceiling ... but the real hard work is just beginning for stevie mccrorie . so can stevie mccrorie break the curse and become the first ever success of the voice uk ? his debut single will be lost stars , a cover of adam levine 's hit from the film begin again , which was nominated for an oscar this year . the scotsman has also reportedly been asked to perform at music festival t in the park already . stevie 's coach ricky wilson , frontman of rock band kaiser chiefs , has been quick to defend his protege in the face of criticism . when asked if he 's worried about the growing number of the voice uk flops , he simply replied , ' stevie has n't won it before . ' so now it 's all eyes on you stevie ! no pressure ... though it 's not always the winners who reap all the success ( steve brookstein , case in point ) , the x factor has produced far more chart successes than the voice uk . here are just a few of the best-selling artists that came from simon cowell 's itv show : one direction they did n't win , in fact they came third , runners up next to matt cardle and rebecca ferguson in 2010 , but simon cowell 's boyband has sold over 50 million albums and quite literally , taken over the world with their legion of fans . leona lewis despite having left simon cowell 's label sycon last year , leona remains one of the show 's biggest successes , having sold over 4.4 million singles off the back of her 2006 win . jls the runners-up of the 2009 series , jls went on to sell over 3.9 million singles and 2.7 million albums , before splitting up in 2013 . olly murs he came second to joe mcelderry in 2009 , then went on to sell almost as many albums as jls and co-present the x factor 's sister show xtra factor in itv2 with caroline flack . alexandra burke after winning the 2009 series following her duet with beyonce , alexandra went on to rack up more than 1.25 million sales for her debut single hallelujah . james arthur before the singer landed himself in hot water with volatile twitter rants , he clocked up over 1.2 million sales of his first single impossible after winning the 2012 series . little mix the first ever group to win the show in 2011 , little mix have now beaten the spice girls ' chart success in america and raked up an impressive 132million vevo views . rebecca ferguson though she came second to matt cardle in the 2010 series , rebecca has just released her third album lady sings the blues and has enjoyed steady chart success .	stevie mccrorie has been crowned the winner of the voice uk 2015 mentor ricky wilson , his fellow celebrity judges rita ora , tom jones and will.i.am will.i.am will.i.am , and most of all bosses at the bbc will all have their fingers crossed for his success it 's not just a hit single stevie needs , he also has to break the curse of previous winners who have failed to do anything but flop out of the charts	stevie mccrorie has been crowned the winner of the voice uk 2015 . his mentor ricky wilson is confident stevie could be just what the bbc needs to pull their talent show out of ridicule . leanne mitchell has been dropped by her record label and now works as a holiday camp performer .	stevie mccrorie has been crowned the winner of the voice uk 2015 . he beat fellow contestant lucy o ` byrne in the final . but he has to break the curse of previous winners who have failed to do anything but flop out of the charts .	stevie mccrorie has been crowned the winner of the voice uk 2015 . beat fellow contestant lucy o'byrne in the final . mentor ricky wilson is confident stevie can break the curse of previous winners who have failed to do anything but flop out of the charts .	leanne mitchell , the first ever winner of the voice uk , has been dropped by her record label decca she blew everyone away with her version of whitney houston 's i would run to you in the live final she failed to rank any higher than number 45 in the music charts a year later her album , a record of songs written entirely by her rather than a compilation of cover versions , failed to chart in the top 100	stevie mccrorie has been crowned the winner of the voice uk 2015 .his mentor ricky wilson is confident stevie could be just what the bbc needs to pull their talent show out of ridicule .leanne mitchell , the first ever winner of the voice uk , has been dropped by her record label .

abby bishop 's ( right ) life completely changed when she took in her niece zala ( left ) . most professional athletes are used to having their lives centred on themselves and their sport . but when basketballer abby bishop was just 24 , her life completely changed when she took in her two-day-old niece zala . it was august 2013 and bishop suddenly found herself caring for a newborn , juggling training with sleepless nights and adjusting to her new life . now zala is 20 months old and she follows bishop as she travels the world playing for professional teams , and will go with her to the u.s. this may when she starts playing for the seattle storm in the wnba . bishop , now 26 , said it was a big decision at the time but she would n't change anything . ' my sister wasn’t very well , ' she told daily mail australia . ' i pretty much brought zala home and started pre-season training with the canberra capitals straight away . ' it was tough with no sleep and adjusting to having another little human with me 24/7 , but i have amazing friends who help me and my mum helped me when she could . ' i 'm not going to lie and say it was easy but i just got through it . ' bishop had planned to spend a few years living in europe full-time playing basketball , but she had to adjust her plans to do what was best for zala . she chose to base herself in canberra , sometimes flying interstate with zala for weekend matches . bishop was also able to take zala with her to hungary , where she played for local basketball teams for a couple of months in february 2014 and again in february this year . ' there are a few things i 've missed out on , but i do n't feel like i 've missed out i 've made the best of the situation , ' she said . the basketballer , who lives in canberra , has looked after her niece since she was two days old . now zala is 20 months old and she follows bishop as she travels the world playing for professional teams . ' all the teams i 've been part of have just been amazing in terms of taking me and zala on . ' my european teams paid for my nanny 's flights and they had cots and car seats and toys and everything there . ' i just ca n't thank the canberra capitals enough for putting childcare in my contract and letting me take zala on road trips . ' but it has n't all been smooth sailing . bishop had to miss out on playing for the national opals team in the world championships in turkey in october last year because of issues with their policy , which would have required her to cover the cost of travelling with a nanny . ' taking on zala i knew i was going to have to deal with some things within sport and for me that was not being able to go to world championships because of the policy they put in place , ' she said . bishop was able to take zala with her to hungary , where she played for local basketball teams for a couple of months in february 2014 and again in february this year . bishop said zala loves travelling and acting as team mascot . they are pictured here together in hungary . zala will go with bishop to the u.s. this may when she starts playing for the seattle storm in the wnba . ' i 'd just taken on a baby that was n't mine and they were n't as understanding as all my other teams have been . ' i understand it 's the highest level , playing for australia , but it 's a unique situation and needs to be looked at differently than another mother 's situation with a husband and a biological child . ' bishop is glad she will be able to take zala with her when she goes to the u.s. to play with the seattle storm in may . ' in seattle their rules in terms of contracts are very strict but in their own little way they have helped me , ' she said . bishop said zala loves travelling and acting as team mascot . ' the plane trips are always the tricky part , just because she 's so active , but in terms of being over there she loves it , ' bishop said . bishop has had to make a lot of adjustments to her life – including getting used to a lack of sleep . ‘ i think the biggest thing was it wasn’t all about me anymore , my life turned to being about this little human’ . ' everyone loves her and treats her like she 's part of the team . ' she loves the attention - all they like is attention at that age . ' bishop has had to make a lot of adjustments to her life – including getting used to a lack of sleep and the fact that she is now responsible for someone else 's life . ' i think the biggest thing was it was n't all about me anymore , my life turned to being about this little human , ' she said . ' and just for social things , my friends say `` let 's go out for dinner or drinks '' and i have to say `` nah sorry i ca n't i 've got a child now . '' ' bishop knows that she will need to take a step back from the world of professional sport once zala starts school . bishop , now 26 years old , said it was a big decision at the time but she would n't change anything . bishop said she will need to take a step back from the world of professional sport once zala starts school . ' i 've got a couple more years to do my basketball and do all that and then obviously i 'll have to think about school and where we want to settle , ' she said . when her basketball career comes to an end bishop wants to become a police officer . but until then she is trying to maintain a balance and get back some of her social life – and she hopes to have more kids one day . ' i did n't think about it the day i was taking her , ' she said . ' but since taking her i 've thought hopefully i can find the right person and have my own kids . ' i 'm a person who does n't need someone but it 's something i want in the future . ' until then it 's just zala and i .

the name gary - once one of the most popular name in britain - is now heading for extinction . just 28 of 700,000 babies born in the uk in 2013 were given the name , data from the office of national statistics shows . that compares to 235 garys being born in 1996 , when the name was the 147th most popular in britain . in 2013 , it did n't even make the top 1,000 . all in a name : others suggest that gary lineker , left , or take that singer barlow might have put some off . helped by the popularity of actor gary cooper , there was a surge in garys born in the us in the early 1950s . there was even a trend of girls being given the name . the name peaked in britain roughly decade later . in 1964 , it was ranked 16th most popular . since then , there has been a fall in the number of garys . it is now among a number of once-common names that are close to dying-out completely . fall from grace : some blame shamed pop star gary glitter , pictured , for the name 's declining popularity . there has been suggestion that football pundit lineker , or take that singer barlow might have put some off the name . but others point to britain 's most notorious gary , paedophile pop star glitter , who was jailed for 16 years for a string of sex attacks on girls , as the reason behind the name 's fall from grace . speaking to the sun , gary davis , from south london , said : ' gary glitter has obviously done us no favours . ' between 1996 and 2013 , unusual names such as dexter ( there were 1,019 born in 2013 ) , jenson ( 1,055 ) and harley ( 1,275 ) all climbed in popularity to break the top 100 . meanwhile , the country went from having no girls called harper - the name given to david and victoria beckham 's daughter - to hundreds . nearly 200 were born in 2013 . other names inspired by famous faces including rihanna ( 60 born in 2013 ) , hermione ( 77 ) and paris ( 107 ) were also more popular than humble gary . data from last year shows a surge in arabic names in the uk , with omar , ali and ibrahim all entering the boys’ top 100 for the first time . for girls , maryam has shot up 59 places to number 35 , while nur is a new entry in the girls’ top 100 , jumping straight to number 29 . and muhammad has risen an astonishing 27 places compared to last year to claim the number-one spot for boys . sophia was the top name for baby girls but the year’s biggest riser within the girls’ top 100 was maryam , while the highest new entries were nur , emilia and gracie . for baby boys , teddy was the biggest climber within the top 100 . the highest new entry was kian . popular : between 1996 and 2013 country went from having no baby girls called harper - the name given to david and victoria beckham 's daughter - to hundreds . above , harper with her brothers and father last month . girls . alpha - alpha may be the first letter in the greek alphabet , but it’s one of the last names modern parents consider for their baby girls . not so in 1880 , the first year baby name records were kept in the us , when alpha was number 301 . it dropped off the top 1000 in 1944 and is about to disappear for good . barbra - singer barbra streisand made her unusually-spelled , condensed name famous in the 1960s , when it peaked at number 511 , only to drop off in the top 1000 in 1971 . barbara , a top 10 name for three decades , hangs on in the top 1000 , but barbra is about to vanish . claudine - this feminization of the ancient roman name claudius ranked in the top 1000 for first half of the 20th century , then blipped to a new height in 1970 on the popularity of singer claudine longet , only to fall off the charts in 1975 . claudine along with most other once-popular –ine and –een-ending girls’ names are now out of favor . nanette - nanette ranked among the top 1000 until 77 , peaking in 1956 . but today , most parents say no to nanette . sheba - sheba is the short form of the biblical bathsheba , disappearing from view with only five baby girls named sheba in the us in 2013 . sondra - sandra’s exotic sister sondra ranked in the top 1000 from the 1920s through the 80s , peaking in 1939 . but the devastating hurricane sandy took a lot of wind out of all forms of this name , given to only five girls in 2013 . thisbe -thisbe was never ranked in the top 1000 , but this ancient mythological name – she was a doomed young lover whose tale inspired romeo & juliet – is about to vanish from the modern lexicon . zelma - zelma nearly broke the top 200 in 1902 but fell off the list in 1955 . selma , thelma , and even velma , might be hanging on by the tips of their antiquated fingernails , but zelma is about to lose her grip on modern usage . boys . elmo - just over a century ago , this short form of guglielmo , the italian form of william , stood at a respectable number 247 , hanging in there until the 1950s , when it disappeared from view . any hope of revival was shattered by the ticklish toy from sesamestreet . icarus - a dramatic greek mythological name , icarus is known for flying too close to the sun with dire consequences . his name has never broken into the national top 1000 , probably due his rash reputation and the icky sound of the first syllable of his name . inigo - inigo is another name that’s never ranked here , though it’s admired enough on nameberry to make it number 261 . it’s the medieval spanish version of ignatius , which has ranked as high as number 602 on the national list and was used by cate blanchett , but inigo is a no-go . llewellyn - a common name in wales , with the distinctive welsh double-l beginning , llewellyn appeared on the us list for six decades , ending in the early 1940s . but despite its rich welsh history , literary cred and quirky nicknames , llewelyn seems headed for extinction . remus - with his twin brother romulus , he was a legendary founder of rome . but the stereotypical image of uncle remus , plus the unpleasant first syllable , have kept him permanently off the top 1000 . sherwood - the stiff surname sherwood , which does have the distinguished namesake of influential novelist sherwood anderson , managed to make it onto the list from 1897 to 1963 , peaking at number 533 in 1938 , anderson’s heyday , but it hasn’t been heard from in the 7+ decades since then . waldo - where’s waldo ? he’s nowhere to be found except on the birth certificates of a scant five boys last year . waldo actually reached as high as number 347 in 1881 and remained on the list till 1941 , when it became a victim of anti-german sentiment .	only 28 of 700,000 babies born in the uk were given the name , data from the office of national statistics shows that compares to 235 garys being born in 1996 , when the name was the 147th most popular in britain in 2013 , it did n't even make the top 1,000	just 28 of 700 , 000 babies born in the uk in 2013 were given the name . that compares to 235 garys being born in 1996 , when the name was the 147th most popular in britain . in 2013 , it didn ' t even make the top 1 , 000 .	just 28 of 700,000 babies born in the uk in 2013 were given the name . that compares to 235 garys being born in 1996 , when the name was 147th most popular . in 2013 , it did n't even make the top 1,000 . some blame shamed pop star gary glitter for the name 's decline .	gary was once one of the most popular names in britain . just 28 of 700,000 babies born in 2013 were given the name .	just 28 of 700,000 babies born in the uk in 2013 were given the name that compares to 235 garys being born in 1996 , when the name was the 147th most popular in britain in 2013 , it did n't even make the top 1,000 gary lineker , or take that singer barlow might have put some off the name	just 28 of 700,000 babies born in the uk were given the name , data from the office of national statistics shows .helped by the popularity of actor gary cooper , there was a surge in garys born in the early 1950s .it is now among a number of once - common names that are close to dying - out .

armstrong , 26 , pleaded guilty of trying to bring a stun gun , a baton and knuckle dusters back into the uk from cyprus in his luggage ( file picture ) . a holidaymaker who jetted off to cyprus to celebrate his new job was sacked before starting after returning with a stun gun , baton and knuckle duster in his luggage . paul armstrong , 26 , of sunderland , flew to cyprus with four friends before beginning his new role as an it project manager . but after a spending spree on the trip , armstrong was stopped at the airport with the stun gun disguised as a torch , extendable baton and knuckle duster stuffed in his luggage . a court heard how the stun gun was capable of administering an electrical discharge which would cause a victim to ' startle and repel ' . armstrong pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm and two offensive weapons and lost his job before he even started it . judge john milford qc told newcastle crown court : ' the general public need to be warned about the gravity of bringing home such souvenirs . ' what he did was foolish . it must be realised that the court takes very seriously the bringing into this country of those items . ' a stun gun is , within the legislation of this country , a firearm . it is an extremely serious offence to possess one . ' it is highly undesirable that they should be in circulation in this country . ' the 26-year-old was sentenced to eight months imprisonment , suspended for two years , with £2,000 costs at newcastle crown court ( pictured ) . the judge said a prison sentence was not necessary in armstrong 's case as there was no suggestion he would use the weapons , had never been in trouble before and had recently found employment . judge milford added : ' he had an extremely good job lined up . as a consequence of these proceedings , which he had to reveal to his perspective employers , he lost that job . ' as such , armstrong was sentenced to eight months imprisonment , suspended for two years , with £2,000 costs . glen gatland , defending , said ; ' he has never been in trouble with the police and is of previous good character .

eerie footage has emerged showing a mysterious 100 metre-wide black ring of smoke floating over clear skies in kazakhstan - convincing locals it was caused by a ufo . the clip was filmed on saturday in shortandy village , 40 miles north of the capital astana , and captures the cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing without trace . the video has been viewed more than 50,000 times since being uploaded to youtube , prompting all manner of bizarre explanations for the phenomenon - with many seemingly convinced it is definitive proof of extra-terrestrial life . spine-chilling : the creepy footage shows a mysterious 100 metre-wide black ring of smoke floating over clear skies in kazakhstan - convincing locals it was caused by a ufo . confused locals watched the mysterious cloud hover ominously over shortandy for a quarter of an hour on saturday morning before it vanished as quickly as it appeared . once the cloud had rapidly dispersed , no trace of it was left in the sky . speaking to local news website today.kz , villager oleg menshikov said : ' it was like a black cloud . we saw it at around 4 pm on april 3 . it dissipated like smoke , but it was completely odourless . ' within minutes of the video being shared online , youtube users began to question whether the thick black hoop was an alien spacecraft , while others suggested it might just be cigarette smoke immediately in front of the camera but giving the perception it is in the sky . others thought the cloud was likely to be a naturally occurring weather event known as a thermal microburst , which is caused by a falling mass of warm air . mysterious : the clip was filmed on saturday in shortandy village , 40 miles north of the capital astana , and captures the cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing without trace . dispersing rapidly : confused locals watched the mysterious cloud hover ominously over shortandy for a quarter of an hour on saturday morning before it vanished as quickly as it appeared . experts believe the cloud was roughly 100 metres in diameter and floated close to a mile in the air . speaking to russia today , andrey solodovnik - associate physics professor at the northern kazakhstan state university - dismissed suggestions the cloud was caused by aliens . he said that based on similar clouds seen in the skies in recent years , the giant black hoop was likely to have been little more than a smoke ring generated by combustion at nearby factories . plenty of industrial machinery is known to create ring-shaped clouds of smoke , though these are usually lighter-coloured , considerably less dense and vanish in just one or two minutes . in the latest instance it is likely the cloud was far more visible and hung around in the sky for much longer than usual for the simple reason it was cloudless day with little to no wind .	the video was filmed on saturday in shortandy village , 40 miles north of the capital astana , and captures the cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before vanishing without trace it has been viewed more than 50,000 times since being uploaded to youtube , prompting all manner of bizarre explanations for the phenomenon - with many seemingly convinced it is definitive proof of extra-terrestrial life	clip was filmed on saturday in shortandy village , 40 miles north of astana . captures the cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before vanishing without trace . video has been viewed more than 50 , 000 times since being uploaded to youtube .	video was filmed on saturday in shortandy village , 40 miles north of capital astana . it captures the cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing . baffled locals watched the cloud hover ominously over the village for a quarter of an hour . video has been viewed more than 50,000 times since being uploaded to youtube .	clip was filmed on saturday in shortandy village, 40 miles north of astana . captures the cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before vanishing . video has been viewed more than 50,000 times since being uploaded to youtube .	the clip was filmed on saturday in shortandy village , 40 miles north of the capital astana it captures the cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing without trace the video has been viewed more than 50,000 times since being uploaded to youtube experts believe the cloud was roughly 100 metres in diameter and floated close to a mile in the air	the clip was filmed on saturday in shortandy village , 40 miles north of the capital astana , and captures the cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing without trace .the video has been viewed more than 50,000 times since being uploaded to youtube .many seemingly convinced it is definitive proof of extra - terrestrial life .

andrew flintoff fears kevin pietersen is ' running out of time ' to resurrect his england career . flintoff , speaking at the england and wales cricket board 's natwest t20 launch , sees a bright summer and lasting future ahead for ' probably the premier tournament ' in this country . the dual ashes-winning all-rounder is less convinced , however , about pietersen 's prospects of forcing his way back into test contention . kevin pietersen scored 170 for surrey in the parks as he bids to earn a recall to the england squad . former england star andrew flintoff thiks time is running out for pietersen to resurrect his england career . pietersen already has three ashes series wins on his cv but will be 35 before the 2015 edition begins , and flintoff senses he no longer has age on his side . the controversial record-breaking batsman has been surplus to requirements since being sacked 14 months ago after alastair cook 's team were whitewashed 5-0 in australia , but has taken heart from incoming ecb chairman colin graves ' hints that there may be a way back after all . pietersen and his agent have both spoken of the ' clean slate ' being presented to him , and he began restating his case by hitting 170 against mccu oxford in his first red-ball innings for surrey since june 2013 . flintoff is concerned nonetheless that there is simply no vacancy for pietersen . ' he 's a fantastic player , but nobody just walks into any team - especially the england team , ' i 'm back , i 'm here , i 'm playing ' , ' flintoff told press association sport . england have won their last three tests under cook , pre-dating a miserable world cup , and took a three-figure first-innings lead in the first match of three in the west indies . pietersen has not featured for england since he was unceremoniously sacked 14 months ago . it is hard to identify anyone in their middle order who should step aside , on current form . ' which of them do you say `` you 're not playing ! '' for kevin to come in ? ' flintoff said . ' i just think kevin is running out of time a little bit . ' if he 'd started the season last year with surrey , and scored run after run and put himself in the position ... whereas now i think he 's looking at the ashes and he 's just running out of time . ' that 's not to say he ( definitely ) wo n't feature , but i ca n't imagine it 's going to be in the near future . ' flintoff is optimistic about england 's fortunes , despite their winter woes , with or without pietersen . ' alastair cook is so important , and you get the sense everyone within the england set-up wants him as captain , ' he said . ' he 's a popular lad , and a great player . ' peter moores , there are n't enough words for me to describe how great he is as a person and coach - an amazing bloke . ' the former england star is hoping to win back his test place with a return to red ball cricket . england , flintoff believes , just need a little more support . ' i think sometimes as a pundit , ex-player , you forget how difficult it can be , ' he added . ' in australia , you have all the ex-players talking to the current players and you get a sense that everyone wants australia to do well . ' with england , i 've never had a sense of that . ' it 's about time we started talking them up . i think it 's time we started supporting the side , getting behind cook , moores , the players . ' it 's very easy to take cheap shots and swipes and pick out a player who has n't moved his feet . ( i think ) maybe we should be a bit better than that , and start celebrating the lads a bit . ' he is enthusiastic too about this summer 's t20 blast , insisting it is no poor relation of the indian premier league - or the big bash , in which he played last winter for brisbane heat . flintoff says alastair cook is so important to england despite poor showing in the first test against west indies . flintoff said : ' the competition gets stronger . it 's probably the premier tournament of the domestic game now , with the crowds and excitement behind it . ' we 're seeing that , with some of the players coming over - the world 's best , chris gayle , brendon mccullum , ( glenn ) maxwell , ( aaron ) finch . ' i played in the big bash , and the standard was high ( but ) this stands up as a competition . ' you turn up at old trafford for lancashire-yorkshire , and get 25,000 people , then to chelmsford where they 're playing in front of packed houses - so i do n't subscribe to that . ' anything in this country , we look at things abroad and say everything is far better over there . ' we do n't really focus on what we 've got . flintoff shares a joke with players at the natwest t20 blast launch at edgbaston on thursday . ' i did n't see anything within the big bash and thought ' this is far better than what we 've got at home ' . ' whether at 37 he will be a part of the blast again , after coming out of retirement and so nearly helping lancashire to win the tournament last summer , is another matter .

i spoke to carl froch for an hour this week and we have talked long and hard about what he is going to do next . needless to say , we were disappointed to see julio cesar chavez jnr lose at the weekend against andrzej fonfara . it wasn’t a result we were expecting and it also blows away the chance of froch and chavez fighting in las vegas – a fight carl wanted . now we turn to three big fights in the next two months to see what carl does next . i have held talks with gennady golovkin’s manager and there is also the possibility of bernard hopkins , but there are three fights coming up where the winner could work for carl . carl froch ( left ) has not fought since beating george groves at wembley last may . froch has kept in shape and weighs 12st 7lbs - despite being away from the ring for nearly a year now . froch had hoped to meet julio cesar chavez jr , but he lost to andrzej fonfara last week . there is the possibility of paul smith-andre ward in the pipeline , anthony dirrell versus badou jack for the wbc world title and andre dirrell’s ibf world title fight against james degale , which is the biggest bout of this trio . anthony dirrell’s people have already been in touch with me about a froch fight in the event that he wins , but i wonder if it is big enough . a fight against degale still feels to me like the most probable , if he comes through against dirrell on may 23 . that is a huge fight , a proper 50-50 , but i fully believe he can do it . for me , from talking to carl , i think he needs to fight again in 2015 if he is to ever return . if doesn’t come back this year , i don’t think he will . he has been a year out of the ring so let’s see . i know he is going to have an eagle eye on all these fights . the possibility of him retiring is very high but he is still training hard . he is walking around at 12st 7lbs and in the gym four to five days a week . the guy has the hunger but it has to be for the right fight and the right money . my belief is still that it might be degale . degale has looked sensational in camp and is improving at a brilliant rate – if he wins the title over in the us he will be in a great position . i mentioned golovkin before . when i was on the phone to carl he spent 20 minutes talking about the guy . he is a fighter that absolutely fascinates him ; it’s a fight that would get everyone talking . i am looking at it . it would have to be at 168lbs and it would be special . i wouldn’t want to be the one to find out how golovkin punches at the weight but carl has a sick mind like that . i’m not going to rule that one out . james degale ( right ) has now emerged as the most likely next opponent for froch on his return . another option for froch could be a rematch with ward , should the american beat paul smith . after a disappointing couple of weeks it seems that my hopes to stage carl frampton-scott quigg this summer are dead in the water . we received no offers from their side and made three of our own – we offered a 50-50 split , a 60-40 in favour of the winner and also a £1.5m guarantee to frampton . i sent that last offer in writing to them and had no response . you ask yourself who is making these decisions ? it is life-changing money for frampton that has been offered . let’s hope they don’t spend the rest of their lives kicking themselves . scott will move on and fight on july 18 . i can guarantee that in his next fight he will fight a tougher opponent than frampton will . scott quigg ( right , in action against hidenori othake ) will fight on july 18 against an unnamed opponent . carl frampton 's team failed to make an offer to fight quigg , according to his promoter hearn . hearn went live on sky sports to offer frampton and his team £1.5m to fight quigg . anthony joshua has been added to my may 9 show in birmingham , where he will fight rafael zumbano love , the south american champion . he is 6ft 4ins and this will be a good test for anthony against a big man before he then has his 02 fight against kevin johnson on may 30 . we are keeping him busy , which is what he wants . i saw him in the gym this week and he is looking awesome . after the johnson fight he will be out again on july 18 in manchester and then in september in a big fight . watch this space . anthony joshua ( left ) beat jason gavern ( right ) last time out and will now face rafael zumbano love .	carl froch has n't fought since beating george groves at wembley last may froch has been away from the ring for nearly a year and is now 12st 7lbs anthony dirrell 's ibf world title and andre dirrell 's people have already been in touch with me about a fight in the event that he wins , but i wonder if it is big enough i know he is going to have an eagle eye on all these fights . he is walking around at 12st 7lbs and in the gym four to five days a week a week . i 've held talks with gennady golovkin 's manager gennady go	carl froch has not fought since beating george groves at wembley last week . the possibility of him retiring is very high but he is still training hard . froch is walking around at 12st 7lbs and in the gym four to five days a week .	we were disappointed to see julio cesar chavez jnr lose to andrzej fonfara . now we turn to three big fights in the next two months to see what carl froch does next . there are three fights coming up where the winner could work for froch . i think froch needs to fight again in 2015 if he is to ever return .	carl froch has not fought since beating george groves at wembley last may . the wbc world champion has kept in shape and weighs 12st 7lbs . froch needs to fight again in 2015 if he is to ever return .	carl froch has not fought since beating george groves at wembley last may froch has kept in shape and weighs 12st 7lbs - despite being away from the ring for nearly a year now paul smith-andre ward in the pipeline , anthony dirrell vs badou jack for the wbc world title and andre dirrell 's ibf world title fight against james degale i think he needs to fight again in 2015 if he is to ever return	carl froch has not fought since beating george groves at wembley last may .froch had hoped to meet julio cesar chavez jr , but he lost to andrzej fonfara .froch has kept in shape and weighs 12st 7lbs - despite being away from the ring .

apparently because the clothing ' provokes sexual desire , and shows the attractions of men 's body ' - has been strictly enforced . in fact some young men seen wearing jeans after the ban was put in place were reportedly told they must exchange their denim products for pyjamas , or face time in prison . as well as products made by nike , numerous other items of clothing appear on the leaflet . newly-banned products on the list include anything carrying swear words or sexual phrases . to help non-english speakers recognise the banned terms , the isis leaflet helpfully provides a long list of swear words alongside their arabic translation . nike did not respond to a request for comment on the ban .	the sports brand features prominently on a leaflet distributed in the terror group 's de facto capital raqqa warning isis jihadis about items of clothing they are no longer allowed to wear it comes shortly after one militant decried the popularity of nike among isis fighters , comparing the brand 's name and famous ` tick ' logo to wearing a christian cross his comments prompted a fierce debate with fellow jihadis who argued that it was perfectly acceptable to wear nike products because they are ` comfy and good quality , unlike crosses '	sports brand features prominently on leaflet distributed in raqqa warning isis jihadis about items of clothing they are no longer allowed to wear . leaflet threatens both the buyer and seller of nike products with punishments ranging from a small fine to biting or even imprisonmen . comments prompted fierce debate with fellow jihadis who argued that it was perfectly acceptable to wear nike products because they are ' comfy and good quality , unlike crosses ' .	the sports brand features prominently on a leaflet distributed in raqqa . it warns isis jihadis about items of clothing they are no longer allowed to wear . news comes shortly after one militant compared brand 's name to christian cross .	sports brand features prominently on leaflet distributed in raqqa, syria . leaflet threatens both the buyer and seller of nike products with punishments ranging from a small fine to whipping or even imprisonment . news comes shortly after one militant decried the popularity of nike among isis fighters, comparing the brand's name and logo to wearing a christian cross .	the sports brand features prominently on leaflet distributed in terror group 's de facto capital raqqa warning isis jihadis about items of clothing they are no longer allowed to wear comes shortly after one militant decried the popularity of nike among isis fighters compared brand 's name and famous ` tick ' logo to wearing a christian cross comments prompted fierce debate with fellow jihadis who argued it was perfectly acceptable to wear nike products because they are ` comfy and good quality , unlike crosses '	sports brand features prominently on a leaflet distributed in the terror group 's de facto capital raqqa warning isis jihadis about items of clothing they are no longer allowed to wear .the leaflet threatens both the buyer and seller of nike products with punishments ranging from a fine to whipping or even imprisonmen .
