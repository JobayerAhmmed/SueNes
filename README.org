#+TITLE: Anti Rouge

* TodoList
** Experiment
*** TODO use all CNN data
*** TODO use DM data
*** TODO [#B] use the model learned from CNN data to test on DM data (transfer)
*** TODO [#A] use fake summary and difference as loss function, instead of mutation and score
*** DONE [#A] use only mutated summary, without article
    CLOSED: [2018-11-30 Fri 15:07]
*** TODO when generating mutation, do not change sentence separator
*** TODO adjust hyper parameters and network architecture
*** TODO try LSTM and attention, MLP instead of current CNN

** New Experiment

All with 4 settings:
- UAE
- UAE-Large
- Glove
- Glove-SO

*** TODO mutation with deletion only
good
*** TODO negative sampling with CNN/DM
N/A

*** TODO negative sampling with NYT
*** TODO sentence level mutation with NYT

** Paper writing
*** TODO write method
*** TODO figures
*** TODO plot results

* Code structure and usage instruction

- =model.py=: models
- =embedding.py=: load glove embedding and USE sentence embedding
- =data.py=: prepare data
- =preprocessing.py=
- =config.py=: hyper parameters

=main.py= glue the data and model together: load data, build model,
train and validate results. Various of experiments are defined in the
following functions.
- =glove_main=
- =use_vector_main=
- =glove_summary_main=

See [[file:log.org][log.org]] for the experiment log.

* Mutation operator

    MODE can be add, delete, mutate (TODO). Generate 10 for each mode.
    
    I need to generate random mutation to the summary. Save it to a
    file so that I use the same generated data. For each summary, I
    generate several data:
        
    1. generate 10 random float numbers [0,1] as ratios
    2. for each ratio, do:
    2.1 deletion: select ratio percent of words to remove
    2.2 addition: add ratio percent of new words (from vocab.txt) to
    random places

    Issues:
    
    - should I add better, regularized noise, e.g. gaussian noise? How
      to do that?
    - should I check if the sentence is really modified?
    - should we use the text from original article?
    - should we treat sentences? should we maintain the sentence
      separator period?
