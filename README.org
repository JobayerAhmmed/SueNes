#+TITLE: Anti Rouge

* TodoList
** Experiment
*** TODO use all CNN data
*** TODO use DM data
*** TODO [#B] use the model learned from CNN data to test on DM data (transfer)
*** TODO [#A] use fake summary and difference as loss function, instead of mutation and score
*** DONE [#A] use only mutated summary, without article
    CLOSED: [2018-11-30 Fri 15:07]
*** TODO when generating mutation, do not change sentence separator
*** TODO adjust hyper parameters and network architecture
*** TODO try LSTM and attention, MLP instead of current CNN

** Paper writing
*** TODO write method
*** TODO figures
*** TODO plot results

* Code structure and usage instruction

- =model.py=: models
- =embedding.py=: load glove embedding and USE sentence embedding
- =data.py=: prepare data
- =preprocessing.py=
- =config.py=: hyper parameters

=main.py= glue the data and model together: load data, build model,
train and validate results. Various of experiments are defined in the
following functions.
- =glove_main=
- =use_vector_main=
- =glove_summary_main=

See [[file:log.org][log.org]] for the experiment log.
